"Driverless cars should not be aloud. The roads are already unsafe, it could harm other people and It would be very costly to afford a driverless car. If we invented driverless cars it would become a problem. ""In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.""

The roads are already unsafe. People are already reckless drivers and don't follow the rules or pay attention to the roads. If we were to get driverless cars, do you think people would more careful? Cars have sensors, cameras ,GPS etc. already built into cars. Why do we need cars that can drive by themselves? It is unnessisary for us to drive driverless cars. In the 7th paragrapgh is says "" The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when a situation requires."" If the car is driverless why would we have to take over it should be safe as possible?

Driverless cars could harm other people on the roads. If a car is incontrol, a human will not be able to stop it. With all of the technology getting put into cars we could be in big trouble in the future. Do you want a car that is driverless? More accidents could happen, if a driver is in the front seat and the car is driving by its self, and the person is not paying attention to the road and something is going on with the car do you think that would be safe?

Driverless cars could be very costly to people, with everything they are trying to put into cars, the cars could be very high in price. So why make them? If only a couple hundred people can aford them why waste all the time to build one. I think driverless cars should not be aloud. Think of someone you know in one, its very unsafe.

In conclusion, cars should not be driverless. The roads are already unsafe as it is, it could harm other people on the road, and it could be very costly. Driverless cars should not be aloud.",0

"In ""The Challenge of Eploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. All throughout the artical the author gives lots of information on why we should study venus even with there being danger all throughout the planet. he talks about the dangers there could be, but the reward would be bigger in the long run if we explored venus. because of that he wishes to do so.

in paragraph 8 he states "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the instigtht to be gained by itself, but also becuase human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally itimidating endeavores"". he pretty much says that because of human curiosty it will happen with or without venus having dangers and he believes that we should do somthing before someone else does in the future. he believes even if there is high tempatures, radiation storms, and how 92% of the air is carbin dixoide which is all stated as dangers along with many other dangers of venus on paragraph 3. that we need to do more test and make more things to withstand veuns.

With all of these dangers it states in paragraph 7 ""looking back to an old techonology called mechanical computers. these devices were fist envisioned in the 1800s and played an importan role in the 1940s world war ll"" it wasnt actual computer, they didint exist in those days they were devices that made calculations by using gears and levers. the authour believes that is if somthing like that can survive world war ll than it should be made again to go down for testing and studying on venus.

all throughout the artical he has supported his claim very good on why we should study venus despite the dangers on venus. with loads of things of evedice all throughout this artical he talks about the dangers there could be, but the reward would be bigger in the long run if we explored venus.",0

"When looking at the Facial Action Coding System and seeing what it did for this peinting, I think it would be a great idea to use in the classrooms to reqd the students emotional expressions. Dr. Haung observes that many artists likr da Vinci did, and he relized that tney studied human anatomy, this is how they were abel to paint facilmuscles precisely. Dr. Haung relized that by haveing a machine like this one, doctors would be abel to performe better surgery by useing video surgery and or better graphics for video games, beter quality images of human faces and better muscel pictures would become a huge hit in the medical field.

Dr. Eckman and Dr. Haung were both abel to figure out that if you raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slightly, and raise the outer parts of your cheeks toward your eyes, your lab partner would be clueless on what emotion you were performing. These are the instructions on how to look happy says Dr. Haung. The Facial Action Coding System can even detect when you are forcing a fake smile instead of a real simle.

This is why I feel that putting the Facial Action Coding System into schools acros the globe would be a good thing. Not only would this give the schools feed back on how their students mental state changes throughout the day, but also this machine would help detect early signs of depression and posibly signs of bullying. When students tell teachers they are not getting bullied or hurassed, the Facial Action System might be abel to detect when a student is lying an d or not wanting to share all of the details in his or her life.

These are all the reasons I personally think the Facial Action Coding System should be placed in schools everywhere. People were interested in the face and how the mucels work even whe da Vinci was alive all the way to today when we are atill intdrested in how the fave and muscels not only work, but how they can be minipulated and how each emotion brings on different muscels.",0
"Dear Mr. President,

After reading informative essays on the Electoral College, i believe the Electoral College should be retired and change the election to popular vote during the election of our United States' president.

Although the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution (What is the Electoral College?, 1) it can cause something known as the disaster factor. This happened back in 1960 and 2000. John F. Kennedy was almost replaced by the Democratic electors who nearly succeeded opposing him (The Indefensible Electoral College, 3).

Another worry factor of the electoral vote is a tie. This could mean putting the election of the president into the hands of the Senate. This also makes Wyoming, who has one representative, have equal say with a state like California, who has fifty-five represenatives (The Indefensible Electoral College, 12). This allows for the opposite of the will of the people. Isn't that what we want? The will of the people.

The winner-take-all system in every state also makes the electoral college unfair to voters (The Indefensible Electoral College, 13). Putting the decision of our US president in the hands of a few voters in one state while others don't even get to see the candidates is absolutely unjust.

Although, there are a few reasons we should keep the electoral college. With the electoral college there is always a certainty of outcome (In Defense of the Electoral College, 18). This means that a candidate's electoral college votes exceeds popular vote. This cuts out the factor of a lanslide electoral vote in only one state; keeping in line the will of the people.

The Electoral College process of voting during election time is old, outdated, and unfair to our voting population. As a United States citizen, i think we should leave the election of our president up to popular vote; everyone will have a say and it takes out al the complications of electoral votes and representatives and most imporatantly takes the exact decisions of the will of the people.

Thank you for your time and taking my claims into consideration.

Sincerely,

Aimee Iorio",0
"In 1976, NASA was taking pictures of Mars and found what looked like a human face looking at them. When the news got to the public they emediatly jumped to the conclution that it was an alian artifact. I can reasure you that it is nothing more than a natural landform that looks like a face.

When NASA went back to retake pictures on April 5,1998, it showed that there was nothing at all but a nautral landform. The public still were not agreeing on it just being a landform due to them taking the pictures on a cloudy winter day. So the NASA team took pictures yet again on April 8, 2001. This time a cloudless summer day.

Garvin, a NASA worker, says,""If there were objects in this picture like airplains on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 pictures showed the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

So I rest my case. Even though an alian civilization on Mars is a really awesome thought, its proven to be not true. The face on Mars is no alian arifact, but just a really cool natural landform that looks lilke a face.",0
"Recent software innovations have came up with a really valuable idea. Its for humans and computers to better communicate. Its called FACS( Facial Action Coding System) and it is very valuable. There are many ways for it to be important inside the everyday classroom by being able to change the way an online class is taught. It's read through a students facial movements and able to read human expressions. So when a student gets stuck or can't keep up the computer can recoginze that.

In the passage it states "" a classroom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" Not only is it reading the student to see how he/she is feeling but also change the way something is being taught so the student better understands and wants to pay attention and learn. It goes back to it being a valuable or important in the classroom.

Dr. Huang's FACS is a very valuable and well designed program and it should be used in ever classroom. There are more than a few ways it is needed in a everyday classroom. Students would well benefit from this because a teacher has to teach every kid and it is hard for them to have one on one time with all the students struggling. This would help give students a specially designed program that best suits there needs and abilities. thats why FACS is valuable in every classroom not just in the classrom but maybe even in certain work places or offices where they are needed.",0
"""I'm much happier this way,"" What caused someone to say this? Simply no longer owning a car! Based on how car dependant mostly everyone's life is and how badly most people that don't have a car want one you'd think that going from having one to lacking one must be terrible. Well statisically speaking we might all be moving towards this idea and it might not be such a bad thing!

According to the short article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

Vauban, Germany is home to people that have chosen to give life without cars a shot, many of which love the life style. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car just to go there. Although this has mostly only been done here many have started slowly adopting the idea. As the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, of this article pointed out passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe, and in more car populated areas such as the United States up to 50%. Robert Duffer stated in

Paris bans driving due to smog that in Paris Driving had been limited by their goverment due to extreme levels of pollution and after a short amount of time the ban was called off because the smog/pollution had lowered. Just one of the advantages of limiting the usage of cars would be cutting down these huge numbers and getting rid of these issues, and if you asked anyone im pretty sure they'd say that this one advantage is plenty reason already to look into this. Imagine how drastically improved the planet would be if others adopted what Vauban is already doing!

Want a holiday to promote the limiting of cars? Well there actually is one in Bogota, Colombia! Millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to places like work on this day. It already has three years running so far, even if its raining that day, the mayor claims that it doesnt stop people from participating. This day is starting to also branch out to other colombian cities such as Cali and Valledupar, imagine if eventually it becomes an international holiday, the advantages are everywhere. Due to the limiting of car usage there are more people walking on the sidewalks and this has caused the goverment to improve those sidewalks by making new smooth ones and getting rid of the old cracked ones. More restaurants, parks, sports centers, and even entire shopping centers have been built and opened to the people walking which is a life style improving advantage. If the limiting of cars is done in more places then new things to do and try will open up in that area and in turn prove to be a great advantage from limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has writen about the possibility that in the United States the peak of driving has been reached. As it turns out Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less miles on average, and getting fewer licenses every year that goes by. If such a large population such as the United States is cooling down on car usage why not speed that process up and goverments start slowly but efficiently reducing car usage internationally? This would mean that in public transport there would be more socializing because the people that take that same bus everyday at 7:00 AM along with you would become your friends or at least aquaintances. So when you think about it friendships might even come with car limiting as well!

From the reduction of polution to the improvements of everyday life style to even possibly socializing with new people, the possibilities of car usage limiting are endless. Who knew that a simple taking of a bus or riding a bike to work could have such a large impact on the world around you!",0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a paper that sets out to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After analyzing the paper, I am prepared to make the claim that the author fails to do so. He/she presents a vast array of information on the dangers of exploring Venus, as well as the challenges of doing so, but forgets almost entirely to argue that studying Venus is still is worthy pursuit. The majority of the essay focuses on setbacks, not rewards.

The author begins by explaining how spacecraft cannot survive on Venus long, and that previous missions have been short for that very reason. The pessimistic tone is continued in Paragraph 3, where the author describes the formidable heat, pressure, geology, and weather of Venus, and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts. It states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of hihgly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In paragraphs 5 and 7, possible ways to combat these road blocks are discussed. Left out of the conversation is the ""why?"" The author describes NASA's efforts to bipass Venus's problems (like designing a hovering device or considering the use of mechanical computers) but doesn't fill readers in on why such pursuits would even be worth the effort. The question, ""We can, but why should we?"" is not answered.

To say that the author was not successful in vouching for rearch of the planet Venus is not to say that attempts were not made. Paragraphs 4 and 8 make a few attempts at telling readers why researching is still a good idea. The author informs readers that Venus is of-interest to scientists because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Mentioned also is that Venus is sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation, making its exploration a more economical choice than other planets. Paragraph 8, the conclusion, says, ""Striving to meet he challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here the author is saying that Venus should be studied because we can gather information, and humans are curious. This is not science or fact-based, and is not strong because it is common knowledge, not argumentative material. If addressing why researching Venus is a worthy pursuit is supposedly one of the focal points of the 8-paragraph paper, evidence supporting it should be found in more than two places.

In conclusion, ""The Challlenge of Supporting Venus"" did not do a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In fact 6 out of the 8 paragraphs talk mostly about what a struggle exploration would be, and the work it would require. It focused more on giving the reader facts and figures about why studying Venus would be difficult, nearly impossible, even, but it did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should be worked through, or why researching Venus is a fruitful and worthwhile endeavor.",0
"Have you evr wanted to help take care of animals on a boat, or even go see places that you have never seen before? Well then, you should come join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thia will allow you take care of animals travel to different places, and trust me I have been on there it is very fun. If you are not persuaded enough let me give you 4 reasons why you should join.

The UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Now imagine that, while the animals were over seas the probably got hurt. Wouldn´t you want to help them I know I would. There were night watchmen, his job was to check on all the animals every hour. That sound like alot of work but it´s not.

Here is another reason, besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. I bet you haven´t seen Europe or China. Wouldn´t you like to see there lifestyle there clothes and all the other stuff they have. Probably learn a new language. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. It really was special all of ther colors were beautiful.

My last reason is, after we unloaded the animals we had alot of fun. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Now that is fun, all the time you were takig the animals back you had to keep an eye on them, but when they were unloaded you would have alot of fun.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me. I´m grateful for the opportunity, it mad me aware of people of other countries and their needs. This is why I think you should come and join Seagoing Cowboy program, trust me you will have fun.",0
"Dear Senator,

I would like to argue that we should change to doing the election by popular votes not by the Electoral College. It is unfair to but the pressure of picking the right candidate on the Electoral College. We should just let it be by popular votes because it wold not be that hard to find out which states had the most popular candidate. It would be harder to let the Electoral College pick the candidates.

For starters some people might want to know what to Electoral College is and they might want to send you a letter about it and what would you say? Something along the lines like they are the ones who pick the votes for the candidates? This is what I got out of

Source 1: What Is the Electoral College?

"" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" Some people might not understand that. It also states that it consists of selections of all the electors, it is also a meeting place for the electors to vote for the President and the Vice President, and it also used for counting of the electoral votes made by the Congress. At the Electoral College also consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. Every candidate that is running for President in your state has their own group of electors. They are usally generally chosen the candidaate's party.

In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong.

They want to abolish the College becaus eit is unfair to the people that want to vote for their own candidate's and not have some college do it for them. In that source it states this ""They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College..."" This is what is wrong with the College ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.""

Yes, I know that there are people that think that it is ok for the Electoral College to do all the voting. To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. Yes, I know that sometime it might do easier to use the college and that is ok, but I would like it if it was all about the popular votes.

To end my letter I just wish that you all in the office to thank about what I just said. Also I like to argue that you should abolish the Electoral College. I just wish you all will think about everything i just said and typed to you all.

Yours Truely,

"The Facial Action Coding System is a type of technology that can help alot of things that go wrong and it can also be bad.

This kind of technology can be and cannot be as valuable to read he students emotions because the students will have different emotions each time you read their emotions. So this technology can be valuaable because when you can read the students emotions like if there is something that is bothering them and they dont say anything, this technology can help the staff and teachers know what is going on. and it could be bad because the student who's emotions you are reading is maybe not comfortable with you reading their emotions, so you can get in trouble. So in conclusion this i am nuteral to this type of technology because i believe that it can be good or bad. No t just one or the other.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the possible dangers it may present. Traveling to new places of our world is something that can help better our overall konwledge of things and expand our thoughts. The most intriguing and beneficial tasks usually have the most downsides to them but that doesn't mean we should simply walk away from them. Even though visiting and touching down on planet Venus produces many dangers, it can still expand our imagination and innovation, complete something that has never been done before, and find better ways to travel there safely.

Touching down on the planet Venus will most likely have several deadly dangers to it. ""On the planet's surface, temperature averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" That is notable to be over the limit of what a body can withstand even with the astronaut suit on. ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes."" These conditions aren't like any type of bad weather that we have here on Earth because they can much more easily take the life of people. Visiting the unusual planet of Venus does have many downsides within it, but that doesn't mean we should automatically stop trying to come up with ideas and conclusions and how to get there safely.

Our travels within Earth and beyond it should not be stopped just because of a few flaws. Visiting various new places can only help expand both our imagination and innovation. ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Us as humans should learn that we must take risks every once in awhile if we want to expand our knowledge on various important things. ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, dspite it's proximity to us."" This reasoning should make us want to strive for more factual evidence on Venus and pursue our understandings. Learning more about the planet could possibly help make new advancements that would increase our overall knowledge.

Sending a spaceship to Venus with living astronauts inside of it is something that has never been done before. Astronauts should want to make a change to that record because it is good to participate in something that's new every once in awhile. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" It is scary to think about all of the possible threats this task has to offer since it is known that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" but you also have to think about all of the good things that taking part in this mission may bring. It is okay for people to take risks and step out of their comfort zones because doing this will help our society strive as a whole.

Learning more about Venus in general and the flaws it has will continue to better our information and help us create things that will get us on to the planet safely. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of the Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" This idea of blimp-like travel will allow there to be a safe environment for the ones exploring because it would keep them up and away from the unsafe ground conditions. Another approach that NASA has already made is ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This idea would possibly only be beneficial for a short period of time but it will still allow us to view a newer part of our world. Once NASA and other teams start to gather up more information from the many trips they take, then it will be much easier to find a safer route to Venus.

Despite all of the dangers that are presented by traveling to Venus, our world would be more advanced in our understandings of some of our neighboring planets. Going to new places and taking risks in our lives can potentially do great things for us like improve our techonological advancements, help us come up with better conclusions and all together just make record history. It's not a bad thing to do something different for a change because you never know what incredible possibilities it may lead to.",0
"cars, they wernt invented in the old days. who needs them, not me. screw cars. Ill tell u what u need to know about life and transportation. We can limit car use if u just use this information and use it in your life.

paris has so much smog. Ew!!! No one likes that so lets limit car use. paris has 147 micrograms of matter in cubic meter measurement. Dang taxes! I hate soccer moms, my mom is one so i cant hate them too much. All they do is drive everywhere and use up all the resources so there kid can strike out in little leauge! Now i will tell you how to fix this problem.

if some of the stupid soccer moms driving around there rolling egg (mini van) the car use would be cut in half. Then you might say then what is my little kid going to do. You can read a biycle places just like it said in line 24 of ""car-free day spinning into a big hit bogota. Now ill tell you what kind of bike and what your gonna do with it and your gonna love it!

A bmx bike is what im talking about. you can transportate it to the skatepark to ride the ramps. Its really fun and i love it. Those gas using Mini vans would be off the streets and bmx bikes can take over. Think about our earth for once please.

well to conclude things up car use is oversused highly. It is mainly the soccer moms fault. To fix all the problems in the world everyone needs to get a bmx bike and go ride some dirt jumps and this world would be a happier place!!!",0
"There are many factors that makes Venus a very challenging planet for humans to study. Although Venus is the closest planet to Earth, there are many risks that have made it a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the second planet from the sun which makes it very hard to achieve missions. All of the previous missions were unmanned because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. In the article ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite a challenge it presents, like Venus's thick atmostphere. The planet's surface and the atmospheric pressure is much more greater than what people experience on Earth. The temperature is so much greater that it would crush a submarne. Paragraph 3 states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" There are too many risks from this planet being the hottest planet in the solar system, for people to explore it. It wouldn't be safe for people to experience this incredibly hot planet.

Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader, is NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Vehicles would be hovering miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Paragraph 5 states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" It could be very dangerous with people many miles above the surface, along with the termpature very high. Although it's survivable for humans, it's still very dangerous.

Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader is all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Since the light isn't penetrating the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography effectively, people only receive limited insite on ground conditions on Venus. People have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Paragraph 6 says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Since researchers can't take samples of things like gas, or rocks from a distance, they are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enought to help with their knowledge of Venus.

Studying Venus has many challenges to go along with it. Although studying this planet is a worthy pursuit, some dangers were presented by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which makes it hard for people to explore it if the pressure is so high. Vehicles hover miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Since it's so hard to get close the Venus because of its risks, people have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Although there are many dangers that come with exploring Venus, people get so much out of the result if researchers get to exploring what they needed to, to inform the rest of the people.",0
"Dear, senator I hereby to inform you that I'm in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes, the kind we have now. For many reasons we believe the Electoral College should be abolish due to the process of electing the next president. During the Electoral College voters tend to vote but, not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. We believe that over 60 percent of voters would prefer an election the kind we have now, as I said before. As you know the Electoral College consist of 538 electors, making it a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Californa, making it the state with the most electoral votes, is a state that could rise a candidates votes, and is considered by the following candidates that California could be an enormous help for the candidate. Many voters have many questions regarless to the Electoral Vote, for example; can voters control whom, their electors vote for? Nor who picks the electors in the 1st place?, These are a few questions that many voters have. I believe we should forment and focous more on the popular vote of those who are qualified citizens. The biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors. During an electoral college vote, if the electoral vote ends in a tie, the election would be held in the House of Reprsentatives, whereas state delegations would vote on the president. Candidates don't get to spend time in the states they know, having a chance of not winning. As a result of that, in the 2000 campaign, approximately seventeen states didn't have the oppurtunity to see the candidates. On the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem of elections. Therefore i considerate the electoral collge vote unfair to voters.",0
"Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driveless cars are lethal, illegal, and time consuming to manufacture.

The first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.

The second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This makes the invention difficult to find it's short comings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that alot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.

Finally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time. It takes a long time to produce; this is stated by the author in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" It takes the company TEN YEARS to only create one component of the device. Overall, driveless cars take a long time to produce.

Driveless cars can be conducive and negative to the consumer but the draw backs out match the pros with its dangerous to control, legalization, and time consuming process to manufacture. The technology is not ready yet for this device to hit shelves in markets and is best to wait when there is more money involved for this project.",0
"limiting car usage is an advantage for many reasons, for example, the pollution will become less of a problem, people will be less tense, and we will be devoid of traffic jams, which means less car accidents. To me cars are just something to get you to point A to B, but now that I have read these articles I realize that cars are alot worse for the environment then i thought, and that i should try using of ways of transportation.

In the passage it states ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the community. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole community and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the carfree day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.

Limiting car usage can even make you less tense, as said in the article,"" ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,""said Heidrum Walter, a media trainerand mother of two, as she walker verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Everything is better when car usage is limited it, makes you less tense and less pollution."" "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" When there is less cars on the road there is less possiblity of car accidents or traffic jams.""... leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" During the one day of no car usage, the streets were left of no traffic jams or accidents. The world is a better place with limited car usage. "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" To conclude, the limited car usage is a great way to reduce the amount of pollution, become less tense , and creat less possibility to have car accidents or road jams. After reading these article I have realized that taking othe transportations like bicycle or on foot could have huge impacts on the environment and my own well being.",0
"Dear Senator:

Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, ""focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.

The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College denys that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.

Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates. As an American citizen, you have the right to vote. The Electoral College is taking that away and it needs to be stopped.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME",0

"Dear state senator,

Many people believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, while others believe that the Electoral College should stay as it is. However, what most people who want to keep the electoral college, do not know is that when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Which means that the people do not get a direct vote towards the president. Therefore, it can cause disinterest in people who are eligible to vote. That is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

The first reason as to why I favor in abolishing the Electoral college is because you can not always trust the electors. As shown back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Also, due to the winner-take-all system, candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, it is obvious that they just want to win and you can not trust those candidates, especially the people who promise to do things they know they can not fulfill. The electors that ""the people vote for"" do not want to help their state, they do not even care for the needs of the people, they are just there for the money. Another reason as to why you can not trust the electors is because it is known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people's needs. One of the main reasons as to why this causes disintrest in potential voters. If the people vote directly for the president they have a better chance in speaking up and fighting for what they want therefore, trusting. Those are some of the rights that are taken away by the electoral college and people do not even realize it.

Another reason as to why I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because the electoral college is unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half of the people! If the government really cared for what the people want, the electoral college would have been abolished by now. Studies have shown that only half of the people living in the U.S have voted in the pasts elections. If you really want the number of voters to increase and for citizens of the U.S to express their political preferences you should actually listen to them and abolish the electoral college.

Lastly, the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for. Many voters now in days believe that when they vote, their one vote decides the election but, they are wrong. If they abolish the electoral college the voters would have a better chance in having who they want for president. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished. How do you expect for U.S citizens to vote and express themselves if they are not heard?",0
"Dear, Senator

When voting for the president of the United States we need to make sure he or she will get there job done. I think electoral voting is better than popular voting. There are parites and each candidate running for president in your state had his or her own grop of electors. Thats usually based on the candidate's political party. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. In order for the president to be elected they must have a majority of 270 electoral votes. In the electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. The argument against the electoral college is what they call the disaster factor.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee however, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic reasons.

The first reason is the certainty of outcome. The outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote comprared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

To add onto the five reasons we have the second reason that states Everyones President. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised. They would feel this way because there votes wouldnt count. Our third reason we have Swing states these ones are likely to be most thoughtful. For our forth and fith we have big states and aviod run off elections.

To wrap this up i think electoral voting is a much better way of finding out who the president should be. When you do popular voting it doesnt give you a good idea of what the people think.",0
"I tend to have a negative aspect on driverless cars . I believe we will always need people to operate a car. New cars can do all sorts of stuff like, trafic jam assistance ,they can steer, accelerat ,and break themselves. All of these designs have one thing in common and that is to notify the driver if there is about to be a colision or anything. I also belive that you need human contact when in a car. Would you like to sit in the back of a moving car without a person in the front seat. If there were to be something that the car cant see or feel ahead a fewmiles like a flood how would the car know to stop when it clearly cant see it .how is it soppossed to know what to do. Like if a woman stared to have a sesure or a diabetic or anything like that what would the car be able to do about that. Also i do believe you should always follow the law but in a state of emergencey what if u needed to speed or anything of the sort a car that drives itself could not be allowed to do that surlly it would break rule regulations.

I would not get in a car without a human being behind the wheel I would not put my life in the ""hands"" of a car. a person has feelings and you cant give that to a machine.",0
"In this article of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how a facial recognition software can detect your mood. It is brough up in paragraph six that this software should be introduced into classrooms. Classrooms are already getting technologically advanced and are gaining more expenses from this as well. Adding Facial Action Coding Systems to students' computers will just add unwanted price increases, pointless space takeup, and more complexity to computers in our classrooms.

Adding this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) will just add on to the expenses that schools are already putting into place just to add on to the technology that people are trying to push into schools. If a school of lower income tries pushing this system, taxes and school payments will be greatly increased on parents that might not even want this system at all. Although richer schools may be able to afford this software, it will definitely take money away from sections of the school that actually might need attention such as athletics or even music and art classes. Money saved from not buying a software that is just a want and not a need can fork money over to parts of schools that actually need the money. This software is not a necessity and if bought, can take away money from areas that need attention. Not only is the price not needed to be added to, but this software may not even help students in the classroom.

Students in schools with enough money to give students their own laptops usually have used a lot of money on these already expensive devices. Laptops in schools are most usually used to help students who are sick at home to stay connected to their teachers to get assignments. Other uses for the laptops range from eliminating paper and also researching. The FACS software just adds another layer of complexity to the laptops. In paragraph six, the author talks about how the software can see your reaction to ads on screens and adjust new ads to this facial expression. Not only can you be frowning for other reasons than your computer, but if you are doing schoolwork, why does it matter if you are mad or happy? Laptops are to get work done and get through school to help you research and understand topics more. Laptops are not for fun but are tools to help you succeed in school by helping you learn topics applied by the teachers. This software could be extremely helpful at home, but at school it just makes the laptops more complex than they need to be.

If a laptop is being used in school, it is being used as a tool to eliminate paper and help teachers connect to students on a higher level. These laptops are already complex enough to have several tabs at once, documents eliminating paper usage, and also have online textbooks. Some students who are not very educated in technology may see some information gathered and used by laptops to seem very confusing and maybe even frightening. Adding this FACS to laptops at schools will just change how students are seeing their laptops and can be switched around by students making faces at it. If a student is very sad and looks at the computer, it may make things happier and more colorful, but what happens when somebody is very happy? Will the computer turn dark and very bland to make them sad? The software will add another layer to these already complex devices that is not needed. The software may be a want in the eyes of people trying to make school more enjoyable, but this software is merely useless in connection to learning experience. Even with all of these negatives, there are some positives in that some genuinely sad individuals using this software can be cheered up and will actually begin to pay attention to their screens. This software has many negatives but at the same time might actually be used for good in schools that can afford it and still have money left over.

All in all, this software may be helpful to those outside of classrooms, but in reality it may be too expensive for some to implement into these already expensive devices. FACS at its worst will be a price increase, an unneeded software, and a system that will add complexity to these laptops. But, FACS at its best can greatly increase moods of poeple who have acquired this software in hopes of it increasing moods and helping students focus. This software should be relatively unexpensive which will give schools the ability to talk to families about implementing this software into laptops to help students learn. If a school can afford this software and it is approved by families, this definitely can help students focus unless this is too expensive for schools but is added anyways. To conclude, this software is somewhat useless in a way but it is completely up to the school corporation and the families of the school to decided if this should be implemented into our daily lives.",0
"Is the face on mars a natural landform? I see that the face is just a natural landform. The face is just a natural landform to some others think its artificial. There are many reasons why it is just natural.

In 1976 a photo that was taken on mars was perceived as a face. Since it was 1976 the photo wasnt that great, but then again in 1998 and 2001 more photos were taken and they showed that it didnt resemble a face anymore due to better cameras. From the pictures in the article it looked like a face at first but then the next pictures add a bit more detail and removed some of the shadows, thus it did not look like a face. NASA also put in the caption of the image "" huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" ,this means it was just an illusion given by shadows. NASA also showed the people just to bring attention to mars and they have scientific research on the face being natural.

In conclusion the face is just a natural lanform. when you compare the photos you can see the difference in shape and detail. Some research in the article states the picture shows a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American west. Scientist state all it really is is a martian mesa.",0
"Florida Senator I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appalled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago. The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical. I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential candidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions? Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives candidates different motives for their campaign. I believe that in an electoral campaign, candidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting. However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by candidates, as if they don't matter, so that the candidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from. In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the candidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad. If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded? It makes sense for the candidates to see ""swing states""the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. I don't blame the candidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting. For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which candidate the state's electoral votes will be going to. People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way. The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting. Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, onehalf of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not. I'm sure that a good portion of nonvoters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issuesissues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system. Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place. With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.",0
"With the information that has been found there's no prove that the Face has been structured by aliens. Scientist have stated that the Face was form by natural causes, others say that they may have found more information about the Face but than what they are saying. The Face was made by natural landform not created by aliens.

The face wasn't stuctured by aliens so therefore was made by natural landform. NASA has plenty of evidence that the Face was form naturally, for example that it hasn't really been discovered that aliens actually exsist. Throught the years of 1976 and 2001 there were pictures of the face not yet comepletely form so therefore scientist think it took 25 years to form comepletely. Others may say that NASA has more information than what they are telling us. For instants in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" in paragraph 5 it states that ""evidence that NASA would rather hide."" I argue that the Face wasn't created by aliens but from natural landforms.

Natural landforms, created by aliens no one will actually really know what they think. I think it was naturally formed not created by aliens there really is no real evidence about it created by aliens. There could be thousand possibilites that it was form naturally or created by aliens. There are plenty reasons to believe that it was natural causes but not as much as it being created by aliens, after all who doesn't love a good mystery.",0
"Electoral college is a process of electors and a poupular vote is by the people. In this argue it ask which one would i favor, i have read the artical and as i was reading i have seen that i would keep Electoral college. I have three reason. one of them it's easier for us understand how the prosses works. my second reason is some people dont care about who they vote for, and my third reason is the history of Electoral college.

My fist reason is the the way the process work. The process works as a number of electors. The electors are what count more thoes are what count to see who are next president is going to be they are the final vote. The electors get together and talk it out so see who wins the most votes. The number of electors are 538. About 270 electors are for the president. The election for the president is held every four years after the first Monday in november.

My second reason is",0
"Do you like adventure and fun. If you do the seagoing cowboys program is a great opportunity to do something great. Its not just adventure you make new friends, you have fun, and you see new things. You help people that got affected by world war two. Its a great cause for helping others.

You have time to have fun and you can sightsee its a great chance to do something great with your life. My thoughts on the seagoing cowboy program are,its great you help people recover from world war two. World war two was a horific time for everyone and you get to help people who was affected thats good. You should participate in this there are things you never seen before and you get to tell your family you did something great for a living.

Do you want to work at Mcdonalds if you don't participate in this limited time offer. You get new friends, to see new things, help people feed them help them be a good person insted of sitting at home doing nothing so please help. You need adventure in your life not a boring old job.

"Have you ever had an opportunity to go to europe and help people in need?

First,some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discoverd. For example,if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because,you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like europe,china,italy and greece. Also you will be helping a lot of people and animals because,you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next,but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world diffrent it might be the same to you or even an acheivment you have accomplished. Their are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what your supposed to you wont fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World war 2 was over in europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRRA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRRA said that means you probly would be getting paid. Even if you dont get paid its still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion,all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people,animals,and enviorment. I hope from all the reasons I have given you,you'll join the seagoing cowboys program.",0
"The Innovation

Driveless cars are a big deal in our modern ,new and innovating society. We try to grow and improve every single and ask ourselves how we can change. Many companies such as Google, Audi and Nissan have an idea that could possibly change the world. Driveless cars are what we all have been waiting for ages. Though many people agree with the idea that driveless cars are the next big thing others simply disagree. There are many pros and cons with the innovation of this project.

I agree with the idea that we should try our best get some driverless cars out on the streets. We as the people on Earth should want the world to grow bigger and better, to grow brighter and smarter. Look at us today, we would not have had many of the things we now do if we had never put so much effort on it. Forexample computers, cell phones and even the process harvesting crops. A lot of ideas have bloomed from technology.

Technology plays a major role in our life, and if driverless cars are the next new idea then I fully support it. Just image how much driverless cars could impact our everyday lives. It could make public transportation so much innovative and easier. perhaps driverless cars can lower are car crash and violence rates on our roads. Driverless cars could also help out many people who are hurt or in desperate need of help in certain situations. Driverless cars could be healthier for our enviornment, but who will ever know if do not put time into this project.

Although having driverless cars are great many do not agree. They believe that it is something dangerous and something that nobody should mess with. They believe that it is out of this world and we should not put any money into this project. I agree that this project can fail but atleast we can say that we tried it, right?

We as human beings learn from our mistakes and as of now there are companies like Google who are already making a change. They have dedicated hundreds of hours into cars who today have driven themselves with a passenger more than half a milliion miles without a single crash.

The have asked themselves that same question and now we have electric cars, cars with sensors and cameras, cars with gps. We have alerts systems in our cars now which keeps us safer. A couple of years ago we had none of these things.

Driverless cars are in the near future. People have dedicated so much time and knowledge to improve are generations to come. There is always something new to improve so lets let it be cars for now, 2020 you are just around the corner.",0
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform. A few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took pictures and revealed that the Face was only a natural landform. They also saw that there was no alien monument. Michael and his team said that if it was an ancient civilization, there would've been planes on the ground, Egytian-style pyramids, or small shacks.

NASA revealed the image and they said that it was a huge rock formation formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose, and a mouth. The Face was only an illusion. NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it is a mesa. Michael proved that it was a mesa because what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or butte. These are most common around the American West.

This natural landform is similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The landform in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Middle Butte is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This proves that the Face on Mars is just a landform.",0
"The author supports his idea of how the knowledge of Venus and how it can contribute innovations that would allow their machines that they us to last long enough and the dangers of that is that it can be striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself due to human curiosity it will likely lead us into many equally endeavors.

"I would like to drive a driverless care because you could just sit back and let the car do the driving.

A good thing about driving a driverless car is that you could sit back and let the car do the driving as it says in (paragraph 7 and line 5).

They only time you would have to actually drive the car is in construction or a place where there has been a wreck. The negitive part to this car is that it is probably really expensive. You would actually have to pay attention to the road because the car might not react to something running in the middle of the street at the last second. And another thing might be it may take more part for the car to be driverless, which makes it harder and more expensive to drive.

The driverless car would be a really cool invention that could allow driver to relax but also cause more stress. This wouldn't be a good car for a first year driver but maybe for someone that has plenty of experience with driving.",0
"Popular vote is the way that the presidential voting should be because, of the fact that peoples votes arent actually making a difference in who is to become president of the untited staes of america. Electoral College is the way that  the gov't wants it to happend. Voters dont vote for the president no  ore that for for the people that vote for the president. The american voise is not being heard.

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(1)

""The Electoral College process consists of selectioms of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.""(2) The pluthora of just votes of the people dont really endure in the face that its not counted in for the vote of the President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusingonly on the tightraces in the 'swing' states.""(13) when the candidate know they arent going to win they just step back and try other states if not they know they are going to lose the elections.

""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favo of itare mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections ae spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dle was right: Abolish the electoral college!""(14) The depate between the electoral college and the popular vote is a hard war because, while also the people voice is what matters but while also the electoral college helps out america in the fact that some of the people aren't aware of the votes and who the vote for what so also they might pick a wrng person. While also the people of the unted states of america can be segregationist and some one completely wrong just because of the the candidates race.

In conclusion, the Electoral College isn't the best way to have prsidents elected into office. But it's in the heart of the American people that stand strong hat should vote for the Commander in Chief.",0
"The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this coutry and make america a place of oppurtunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule.

We as american people cannot choose their own goverment, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the canditates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

In source two it says that electorals who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future.  for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.

In source two and three it states the rule "" winner take it all"" . The votes the other lose the,  winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.

In conclusion,  the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.",0
"You may think the Face is created by aliens, but it simply is not. You see, we here at NASA have been studying and researching other planets for years. Don't you think that with our intelligence, we would know if something that looks like alien evidence actually is alien evidence? We would not only let everyone know, but we would make a very big deal out of it. This is just a natural landform.

I know it is silly that there is literally a face on Mars, but it's not as big of a deal as you think. Have you ever looked at the leaves in a tree or the coulds in the sky and seen something put together that resembles an animal or shape? This is kind of like that. It's cool, but it doesn't exactly mean the universe is trying to give you a sign of life. When we released these photos to the public, people thought for sure we were hiding something like we had an agenda to have an alien takeover. They said it was ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars"". Trust me, we wish there was life on Mars! That would be ground-breaking news! We are not hiding a single secret, and we are speaking the truth.

Perhaps, of course, we will find life on the red planet someday. This landform is not evidence to support that moment. On a bright and clear day on April 8, 2001, we took a very high-detailed photo of the face. If there were any outstanding undeniable resemblinces to a human face, we would've seen it. It is much like any other landform from the American West, like a certain one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Truly any other butte or mesa, just this time its on a different planet.

So, afterall, it's settled. This face-like landform on Mars is not a sign of any martians or aliens, sadly. Conspiracy theorists will go on with their unreasonable theories and we will stick to the cold hard facts, thank you very much. I hope you have realized just how wrong everyone has been and just how much more logical you should be thinking. Don't get me wrong, I and most workers at NASA certainly belive in aliens. This just isn't anything to get to excited about. Keep in touch, though, you never know when the next big discover will come about.",0
"All around the world, cars have influence our lives for the good or for the bad. Whether that is getting people to their jobs or getting into an accident. Cars have altered our lives and are doing it constantly. Although for a century cars have benefited humans greatly, cars have negative effects and banning cars can help decrease the pollution all over the world, it saves the little resoucers the planet has, and car accidents will occur less.

To elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. In Vauban, German cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. The idea of restricted areas are getting big ,and for Vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. People in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. In Paris, France their idea to help low the pollution in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. France had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. In Bogota, Columbia they had similar goals as other countries like Germany. Carlos Arturo Plaza said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. In the United States Americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreasing, benefiting the environment. Throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

Moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the environment. The world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. Using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

Now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. It is one of the top reasons for deaths in the United States and possibly in the world. If banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. Banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. Having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. Less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

The world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. Banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. Banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents. Who knows cars may be a thing in the past int he next decade or two.",0
"The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim. The author uses support mainly focused on the idea in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6.

In paragraph 4, the author said that Venus is theorized to once be covered in water, able to provide homes for all sorts of little organisms. They also say that Venus might have been the ""most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They compared it to Earth even more because of how it has a rocky surface and has similar valleys, mountains, and craters. The author spent time comparing Venus to Earth's surface and features for remote resembalance.

Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has ""one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's ""twin"". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and ""avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way."" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

Moreover, the author gives reasoning that ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannnot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Researchers could also not be able to take any samples of anything from Venus from a distance if NASA were to proceed with the blimp-like plan, meaning that the researchers would have no other choice but to go down onto Venus to take samples, even though it's dangerous.

The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",0
"I would join this program because I can help people in needs and I could travel and see things that I wanted to see a long time ago I could travel all around the world all day every day of the week. I like to support Luke for being brave to go out in the bigh world he just got out of high school and he only lives in a small town were very few pepole live. That is the reason i would like to do that program see u next i hope you like my opion.

I support Lukes claims because they are very useful for the activty that he is duing i personnaly support Luke for caring because he didn't have to help people survive.

Luke is a very brave person and i support him for that i like Luke if he was ral or if he is i would like to meet him in person to say how much he helped those people he is a very good person to others.

I would join this program to help Luke and save lifes I really like Luke he seems like a very helpful person and very succesful in life he didn't give up on school or those animals or the people who needed him to help and they probaly thank him for what he has done.

I like the fact that the program teachs you resopnsabilty in life how you can't just think about your self and think about others to and be helpful to others and that is just what Luke did he cared for the other people and not just himself and he cared for animals cause if Luke and Don wouldn't have saved them animals they would be dead or extinct.",0
"Venus, along with Mars are the closest planets to Earth, they also at one point or another might have been similar to our planet. Yet, we have explored Mars much more than we have Venus. Venus has left us mind-boggled on how to study it with it's dangerous conditions, such as the thick acid rain, the average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Though the exploation is worth these risks for we can explore a planet that scienctists believe could have been once similar our own. Nasa has developed many ideas and solutions to hopefully find new ways to study one of the closest planets to us.

The first way that NASA has created to help us observe Venus is a blimp-like plane to fly over Venus. This idea of the vehicle is stated in paragraph 5, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly gorund conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Also later on in this paragraph where it states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" Now these conditions would most defintely be harsh, but would be capable of living through, escpecially astronauts who are/would be trained for these conditions. This would at least give us an above look of Venus and be able to study some of it's physical features.

The problem that NASA would now have is figuring out a way to study up close and on the surface of Venus. They have a solution for this issue as well in the form of old World War 2 computers, the solution to this problem is explained in paragraph 7 as it says,""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..."" Also further on in the paragraph it reads,"" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" And even later in paragraph seven it states, ""By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" These older computers would be able to be dropped down onto the surface of Venus and take samples of the terrain and it's geological features allowing NASA and it's scientists to study the information gather and create better models to study more of Venus and understand the planet.

Another way NASA is thinking to study Venus on it's surface is simple electronics, the ideas and princples of these machines are stated in the beginning of paragraph where it states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The simplified electronics would be used the same way as the mechancial computers, in which to study the terrain of Venus and collect data from Venus and to send it back to NASA allowing them to study the data.

Venus is a very interesting planet with many disadvantages and conflicts like the difficulty of being able to study the planet's terrain or even to be able to observe the planet in a hover-like state from above. If the challenges that NASA faces can be solved with solutions stated above, then Venus could be a very worhty pursuit, so that we may discover the secrets of one of the closest planets to us.",0
"The challenge of Venus. Venus is sometimes called the evening star why because it's one of the brightest points of light in the night time. The nickname evening star is misleading because Venus is planet its the secound planet of the sun. Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus is planet not a star it the secound planet of the sun.

Venus is a planet. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin Venus is the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to Earth. The diffrences of Venus is the speed sometimes we are closer to Mars then Venus because Venus is right around the coner and they have sent many spacecraft to land but not many have lasted a few hours. Venus is referred as Earth's twin planet and closest to Earth.

A thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On planet's surface the average temperatures is 800 degress Fahrenheit and the pressure of the atmospheric is 90 times greater what we experience on our planent. Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus is blanket by a 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has the hottest temperature of any planet in solar system.

Scientists are discussing further visits to its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its was once most like planet in our sytem. Venus can probably could been covered by a ocean and could supported various forms of life. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been sending people to study Venus. Scientists still discuses about futher visits and NASA has send people to study venus.

The author suggests that studying Venus is dangers yes he's right because Venus is one of the hottest planet even though Mercury is closer to our sun beyond the high pressure and heat Veusian weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes. So yes its dangers studying Venus many space craft haven't lasted hours in venus.",0
"I think that driverless cars could be a great thing to have in the future, if they're safe enough to carry out the same actions that a driver can. In the future though, if kids grow up around driverless cars and aren't actually taught the rules of the road, then if there is an emergency that requires the drivers immediate attention as stated in the article, then the driver probably wouldn't know what to do. This can cause injury or even death to the people driving around him/her.

I also think that driverless cars could be a great thing for the future of technology, but the question that is asked in paragraph 9 of the article is very important to keep in the minds of the car manufacturers. If people rely on their car to do the driving for them, then if there is a wreck who is a fault, the driver or the manufacturer? If you do get blamed instead of the manufacturer, then I don't think that it is really fair because you weren't doing the driving and you trusted the driverless car to get you to your destination safely, and it didn't do that.

Considering these things though, if they were to teach the kids or even adult that didn't grow up around these cars the rules of the road and how the car works to prevent accidents like this from happening then i'd be all for driverless cars. They would be super cool in my opinion and if they worked correctly without many reported accidents, then i'd definitely try to get one. While taking drivers ed I was taught to be mindful of people around you and how your actions could effect other people and I just don't think that the driverless cars could really do that like a driver would be able to.",0
"From a sunday drive to a cross country road trip, automobiles play an important role in how we get around. However in recent years more studies have been developed showing the negative about cars: how they affect the environment. Some people believe automoblies are almost single-handedly destroying the Earth we so despirately cherish. Perhaps we should all take into consideration how our car usage is affecting the environment around us. I believe that automobiles are a detriment to our society and we should pay attention to how much we use them.

Smog has become a huge problem especially in highly populated areas where there are lots of cars running at the same time. An interesting solution arised to reduce the amount of polution from cars in Bogota, Colombia as talked about in Source 3. The article tells of a government made holiday that bans car usage in order to reduce the amount of pollution; the government even took it so far as to fine the people not participating in their ""Day Without Cars."" I think this is a marvelous idea because people need a little encouragement to do the right thing and it helps reduce the issue we are facing. Another example of an idea to reduce car pollution is shown in Source 2, this time being in France. It talks about how Paris typically has a higher pollution rate than most cities and the government felt a need to change this. They were willing to ban all gas operated cars for as long as it took to clean up the air. There were exceptions to this rule though in the case of car-pooling more than 3 people, driving a hybrid or electric car, or public transportation vehicles in order to still have everyone get where they were going. It is refreshing to see that some places in the world are taking a stand in resolving the issue we find ourselves right in the middle of.

For a while now cars have been the king of transportation, it seems about time to change things up a little. In source 1 it talks about an experimental german community that forbids the use of cars. By making everything more accessable to the public in nullifies the use for cars. It seems that the main problem with our settlements is we built them around cars rather than building them for people. Another part in source 1 tells about the effort put out by the United States to promote ""car reduced"" communities. They are planning on doing this by making a bigger portion of the federal transportation bill focus on public transportation than on highways. I believe we are heading in the right direction to reduce our usage of cars and focus on alternate forms of transportation.

In the end it can be said that limited car use is a matter we need to pay very close attention to.",0
"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.",0
"Driverless cars is a cool invention. Everyone wishes they can have a driverless car. The cars could be very dangerous also. Drivers still have to be aware because you never know what can happen. The cars are also dangerous because it is not truly driverless, it may not alert you sometimes, and and can cause you accidents in a constrution area.

Driverless cars aren't truly driveless. They can cause bad accidents because of that. The driver should always stay alerted while in the car because anything can happen. In the text it informs us that ""Google driverless cars have driven more than a half a million miles without a crash."" I'm sure the drivers were still alerted so they wouldn't crash.

The driverless may not alert you sometimes. You never know when something can go wrong with the car that can mess up the alert system. In the text it say ""they can steer, accelerate , and brakes themselves,"" that can be a bad thing because if the car had a problem it could use one of those in the wrong situation like accelerating in a workzone area or braking on the expressway.

It can also cause you to have accidents in a constrution work area. Driverless cars aren't perfect so it can mess up at anytime. It basically have a mind of it own so you should always be alert. You can easily have an accident because you'll be fascinated by the driverless car that you wouldn't be alerted. in the text it says"" it has complicated traffic issues such as navagating through roadwork or accidents.

Driverless cars aren't truly safe. You should always be alerted because you'll never know what'll happen. It can cause serious accidents and you can get seriously injured, not just you other people too. It has a mind of its own and human drivers shouldn't a hundred percent trust a driverless car.",0
"Dear state senator, Many people do not think that the Electoral College is not fair, or exact. In fact, people wanted to boycott it in 2000. I suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country, and we should be able to choose our president, not the electors. Also, if we keep the Electoral College, voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting. I will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly. People want a safe election, so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together. It is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions. That is a reason why we should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

The second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we, as in the people of the United States, should have the advantage of voting for our own president, not the electors. The people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions. Electors have different opinions, which is not fair at all since we are not really voting. They are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people. That is the second reason why the government should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

A disadvantage of keeping the Electoral College is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president. In 2012, only half of the whole United States voted for a president. They did not think voting was really necessary anymore, since we are not really voting. It also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore. We basically do not have a say in our own country, and that is not fair to us or the government. That is why keeping the Electoral College is a bad idea, and we should change it.

This is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote, for the good of our country. It is honestly a much better process for our country , the citizens, and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in. Popular voting is fair to candidates and people, we should choose our president, not electors, and the Electoral College is unfair and makes less people want to vote. Thank you for reading and listening to my letter. Have a great day.",0
"The develpoement of driverless cars is unrealistic to me in many different ways. Due to the fact that just one car will need an incredible amount of technology to keep the car itself as safe as possible means that the car will be overly priced. Not only will It be over priced, but the fact that people are going through so much money to make a car that is able to be on ""auto pilot"" shows laziness.

A brand new, average car could cost to about 20,000 dollars. When they add on technology to ensure the saftey of the driver and everyone in the car, the prices of cars will become too expensive for most people, ""For starters, they need a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mountes near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an interial motion sensor."" People will begin to realize that it would only be avaliabe to wealthier people who can pay for an extremly expensive car that will only benifit them in one way. Them being able to have transportation of their own that they do not have to control means that they would more than likely not be paying attention to the road.

The idea of having a vehicle that you do not have to manage while on the roads sounds amazing to everyone. What happens when one or two of the sensors corrupt and the car steers off into the other lane? What if the motion sensor malfunctions while backing out of a driveway and a pedestrian is taking a jog and doesn't see the car backing out? There is no way that the driverless car could be 100% safe at all times. It dangerous to even think about how the car could have a mind of its own while on the highway,""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?""

Transporting from place to place withought having to put your foot on the gas or making sure you remember to put on your turning signals sounds like a great and easy way to go places. Once the driverless car has been out for years and people begin to start using them often, the commubity will get lazy and irresponsible. No one will ever think they will have to drive themselves because they think that the cars will last forever and that they will just get better from the start, Theyre, wrong. The car could end having difficulties after a few years and they will shut down the production of the cars and people will be too lazy to drive themselces around. People will end up being dependent on the cars to do all of the ""hard work"" for them.

In essence, the develpomement of driverless cars is unreliable and should not be procceded with. The technology will raise the prices of the cars and make it impossible to purchase without a problem, it's too much of a risk for wrecks to happen due to failing sensors, and people will begin to rely on the car after awhile. Put an end to driverless cars and lets just stick with the ones we have now.",0
"Although it may seem that there is a ""face"" on Mars, there isn't. There have been conspiracy theories that the ""face"" on Mars is part of the remains of an alien, but that is not true. There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.

After studying the ""face"" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the ""face"" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the ""face"". There are many other theories of what the for may be.

I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the ""alien head"" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the ""face"" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the ""face"" was real, but can you always trust magazines. Magazines will lie sometimes so that they get a story that people will want to read. You can't really determine that the ""face"" is actually a face.

In conclusion, the ""face"" is not a face. Although it may have seemed like a face to a lot of people, it wasn't. Later on this will be a time to laugh at because some people actually thought that the rock formation was a face.",0
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to a national popular vote for electing the president. While the Electoral College was designed with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, recent elections have shown that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote and majority rule that is central to our democratic system.

There are a few key arguments for moving to a popular vote. Firstly, with a popular vote the winner would be the candidate who receives the most total votes across the country. This ensures that every vote has an equal say in deciding the outcome, regardless of what state a voter lives in. Under the current system, presidential candidates can win the election by focusing campaign efforts and visits only on swing states that could vote either way. This leaves voters in many non-swing states feeling ignored. Switching to a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign everywhere and address issues important to a broader range of Americans. 

However, some argue that keeping the Electoral College preserves the federal character of the election and gives smaller states more influence. While this was the original intent, in practice today candidates usually win their states' electoral votes by relatively narrow margins based on the statewide popular vote. So the votes of individuals in non-competitive states are still unlikely to affect the election outcome. Meanwhile, the current system allows a scenario where the winner of the nationwide popular vote could still lose in the Electoral College. This undermines fairness and trust in our democratic process. 

In conclusion, maintaining a system that allows someone to lose the national popular vote yet still become president risks further weakening confidence in rules that are meant to ensure majority endorsement of our elected leaders. A national popular vote is a more straightforward, democratic way to directly decide who Americans collectively choose as their president. For these reasons, I urge you to support a change to election by direct popular vote for this important office.",1
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit citizens and communities. According to passages 1 and 2, reducing the number of vehicles on the road can help improve air quality and public health. Both passages explain that vehicle emissions contain pollutants like nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds that contaminate the air we breathe. When inhaled over long periods of time, these pollutants have been linked to respiratory illnesses and other health problems. By driving less and using alternative modes of transportation more frequently, such as walking, cycling, or public transit, the air will become cleaner and citizens will face less health risks from air pollution.  

Another advantage of limiting car usage highlighted in passage 3 is that it can help reduce traffic congestion on roads. The passage discusses how a large volume of cars contributes to traffic jams during morning and evening commuting hours. When there are fewer vehicles competing for space on limited road networks, traffic will flow more smoothly. This means shorter travel times for drivers and less time wasted stuck in traffic. It can also cut down on congestion-related costs like wasted fuel and work hours lost sitting idle. Passage 1 also notes reduced congestion can have environmental benefits by decreasing vehicle emissions in traffic.

Finally, all three passages note that limiting car use supports more sustainable transportation options. Shifting modes away from private vehicles to biking, walking and public transit creates multi-modal transportation networks that are less dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels. This moves societies closer to more environmentally-friendly methods of travel outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It promotes community health by making active transit more widely used. By informing citizens of these advantages, more may choose to drive less and adopt sustainable alternatives, benefiting both personal well-being and the wider community.",1

"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Evidence from Around the World

The modern world, heavily reliant on motor vehicles, is witnessing a transformation in thinking about transportation. Across the globe, from German suburbs, to Colombian capital cities and beyond, the value of reducing car usage is being recognized. These initiatives not only support environmental sustainability but also contribute to the enhancement of community life, reduction of pollution, and introduction of alternative, healthy modes of transportation.

Initiatives such as the one implemented in the Vauban district in Germany illustrate the potential advantages of limiting car usage on a large scale (Rosenthal, 2009). By implementing “smart planning” strategies such as reducing parking facilities and promoting walking, 70% of Vauban’s families have given up car ownership, leading to less pollution and a more serene community environment. This initiative has exhibited a unique treatment of suburbs, proving that life in such areas can still thrive without absolute car dependency.

While car usage reduction can be seen as an “experimental” situation in places like Vauban, its previse is being adopted worldwide to make suburbs more accessible and less car-dependent. The US Environmental Protection Agency promotes “car-reduced” communities, aiming to balance out the majority of appropriations given to highways in transportation bills (Rosenthal, 2009). If realized, such changes could significantly decrease the US’s greenhouse gas emissions, which count transportation as the second largest source (Rosenthal, 2013).

A direct effect of limiting vehicle use can be witnessed in cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban lifted smog rivalling that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities globally (Duffer, 2014). This drastic measure, repeated on different days according to the car's license plate number, illustrates the immediate results that car-reduction strategies can offer in enhancing air quality.

Bogota, the capital of Colombia, offers a yearly car-free day where citizens exclusively use alternative modes of transportation, boosting public spirit and drastically reducing pollution in the process (Selsky, 2002). This not only promotes alternative means of commuting but also revitalizes the city with an air of communal cooperation. This strategy has even sparked interest in other city authorities from around the world, who may adopt the event in their cities.

Finally, the United States also appears to be experiencing a cultural shift toward limiting car usage by seeing fewer car purchases, less driving, and a decrease in issued licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if perpetuated, could contribute substantially to achieving environmental sustainability goals. In acknowledgment of this shift, car companies are expanding their product ranges and beginning to label themselves as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across varied global contexts. From air pollution reduction to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and the revamp of community life, these initiatives present compelling reasons for further exploration and consideration for adoption by other cities and nations globally. As awareness grows, the possibility of even greater collaborative steps towards a world with less car-dependent economies seems increasingly attainable.",1
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for society and the environment. One of the main benefits is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report from the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the case of Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped reduce the pollution levels in the city (Duffer). Similarly, in Bogota, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event was successful in reducing traffic jams and encouraging citizens to use public transportation, walk, or bike (Selsky).

Limiting car usage can also make urban areas more compact and accessible. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and instead rely on bicycles, public transportation, and walking. This has led to a more vibrant community with stores and amenities within walking distance (Rosenthal). By adopting this approach in more suburban areas, we can reduce urban sprawl and create neighborhoods that are less dependent on cars.

Additionally, reducing car usage can have positive health impacts. Research shows that people who walk, bike, or use public transportation as their primary mode of transportation have better overall health and are less likely to suffer from obesity and heart disease (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can encourage more physical activity and improve the well-being of individuals.

While there may be concerns about the impact on the car industry, it is important to adapt to changing behaviors and prioritize the environment and public health. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle (Rosenthal). This shift in focus can lead to the development of alternative modes of transportation that are more sustainable and less reliant on individual car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about several advantages for society and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities, the benefits of reducing car usage are significant. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and prioritizing the environment and public health, we can work towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Exploring Venus is Undeniably Worth the Risk 

The pursuit of scientific discovery holds great rewards, but often presents real dangers as well. In his article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that studying Venus remains a worthy goal despite the immense challenges it poses. Through specific evidence from the harsh conditions on Venus, the author makes a compelling case for why learning more about our neighboring planet is worth risking great hardship.

The author first details just how unforgiving the Venusian environment truly is. Its surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit would melt lead, and its atmosphere exerts over 90 times the pressure found at Earth's surface due to its dense carbon dioxide composition. Merely surviving even brief exposure to these conditions seems impossible. However, the author explains that much can still be learned from robotic probes designed to withstand such extremes. For example, we have gained valuable insights into atmospheric dynamics and the potential for life elsewhere by hardening our technology to probe Venus's poisonous climate. 

Next, the article discusses the intriguing geological discoveries that further Venus exploration could reveal. Landers may uncover clues to how the planet transformed from a possibly habitable world into the inferno it is today. Comparing Venus to Earth could yield important lessons in climate change and greenhouse gases. The recent discovery of volcanic activity on Venus suggests its geology remains active today, with unknown implications. Clearly, more study of our sister planet holds answers to profound questions about planetary evolution.

In sum, the author provides strong support for the proposition that researching Venus merits enduring its hazards. Even though direct human exploration is implausible now, steadily innovating our probe technology to gradually expand our knowledge of Venus piece by piece is worthwhile. The potential scientific payoffs in fields from astronomy to climate science demonstrate why tackling Venus's challenges remains a worthy endeavor, as does satisfying our innate drive to explore the unknown. For these reasons, the author makes a persuasive case that Venus studies are an invaluable pursuit regardless of the immense risks.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from multiple sources. By adopting car-free or car-reduced lifestyles, individuals and communities can experience numerous benefits, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and greater accessibility to public transportation and local amenities.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Air Quality and Reduced Emissions
Limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality, as cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article on German suburb Vauban, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This data highlights the pressing need to reduce car usage in order to combat climate change. By minimizing the number of vehicles on the road, communities can reduce harmful pollutants and improve public health.

Body Paragraph 2: Reduced Traffic Congestion
Another advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates how limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve overall mobility. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation such as public transit, cycling, and walking, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. This not only benefits those who choose alternative modes of transportation but also individuals who rely on cars by reducing travel time.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Physical and Mental Well-being
Limiting car usage has positive impacts on both physical and mental well-being. As stated in the passage on Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. By walking or cycling instead of driving, individuals can engage in regular physical exercise, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of obesity. Additionally, active transportation options such as walking or cycling have been linked to improved mental health and reduced feelings of anxiety and depression.

Body Paragraph 4: Greater Accessibility to Public Transportation and Local Amenities
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. When communities are designed with smart planning principles in mind, as seen in Vauban's car-free streets, residents have easier access to public transportation options such as trams and buses. This accessibility allows individuals to have more sustainable and convenient travel options. Additionally, by designing communities where essential services and amenities are within walking distance, individuals may rely less on cars for everyday activities like grocery shopping, which in turn reduces the need for excessive car usage.

Conclusion:
As demonstrated by the passages analyzed, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and alleviating traffic congestion, we can create more sustainable and livable cities. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes physical and mental well-being while increasing accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. As the global population grows and the impact of climate change becomes more apparent, it is crucial that we consider the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing smart planning principles in our communities.",1
"The excessive car usage in modern societies is a compelling issue that incurs several negative impacts. These impacts range from environmental pollution to traffic congestion, where the former results in drastic climate change and the latter triggers inconvenience and a slow-paced lifestyle. By examining and learning from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, Bogota, Colombia, and even trends within the United States, this essay aims to highlight the numerous benefits of reducing car usage that could improve the quality of life, the environment, and flourishing urban development.

One primary advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of global warming. For instance, cars contribute 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). In Vauban, Germany, a suburban district devoid of street parking and home garages, 70% of families do not own cars, and as a result, environmental pollution is drastically less (Rosenthal, 2009). Similarly, the ""Day Without Cars"" initiative in Bogota, Colombia, promotes alternative transportation while reducing smog (Selsky, 2002). These examples illustrate the decisive impact of limiting car usage in preserving our environment and mitigating climate change.

Another benefit is mitigating air pollution-induced health hazards. For instance, Paris was hit by an alarming level of smog due to car exhaust emissions. As a response, the city enforced a partial driving ban which reduced smog by 60% in five days (Duffer, 2014). This pollution reduction contributed to cleaner and healthier air for the residents, highlighting the health benefits of limiting car usage.

A less noticeable advantage of such a practice is the promotion of community engagement and physical activity. In Vauban and Bogota, the car-reduced environment results in the prevalence of cycling and walking, which not only boosts health but also strengthens community bonds (Rosenthal, 2009; Selsky, 2002). Additionally, it stimulates a trend of smart planning for the development of suburbs, which helps to create a space for safer and more enjoyable public transportation.

Another intriguing trend is the cultural shift towards lesser car usage happening in the United States. Fewer licenses are being acquired each year, and car ownership rates have been declining even before the downturn, indicating a more fundamental change (Rosenthal, 2013). This cultural shift towards less car reliance could prove beneficial for carbon emissions and the environment. 

In conclusion, reducing car usage has numerous advantages, including environmental preservation, health improvement, promotion of physical activities, and a strengthened sense of community. It is therefore critical for societies worldwide to follow the footsteps of Vauban and Bogota and to adopt initiatives that promote alternative transportation. While the transition may require adjustments and pose challenges initially, the long-term benefits it brings justifies the paradigm shift towards a sustainable and greener future.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Many communities are grappling with how to address traffic congestion, pollution, and other issues stemming from heavy car dependence. Limiting car usage can provide several benefits to citizens and the environment. According to multiple sources, reducing individual car trips would help alleviate these problems while improving health, social interaction, and accessibility.

One key advantage is improved air quality and public health. As Source A discusses, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution in many cities. The fine particulate matter and other pollutants released harms human respiratory and cardiovascular systems. By driving less, either through policies promoting alternative transit or individual choices, there would be lower amounts of these harmful chemical releases. Children, the elderly, and those with respiratory diseases would especially benefit from breathing cleaner air.

In addition, limiting car usage can have economic advantages. Source B notes that time spent in traffic delays wastes both personal and commercial money. By choosing options besides single-occupancy vehicles, there may be less road congestion allowing for more efficient transport of both people and goods. Money once lost idling could instead be spent on local businesses or saved. Communities may also see reduced road maintenance costs if there are fewer vehicles over time wearing down pavement. 

Social interaction is another positive impact highlighted in Source C. With fewer vehicles crowding public spaces, there may be better opportunities for outdoor physical activity and socializing. Walking or biking places allows for incidental conversations not possible from inside isolated cars. Neighborhood cohesion could strengthen as residents interact face-to-face. Additionally, the disabled and young may have improved accessibility if alternative modes of transportation are safer and more widespread than driving alone.

In conclusion, thoughtfully limiting car usage can provide communities with various environmental, economic and social advantages according to the sources. By promoting walking, cycling, public transit or ride-sharing over single-occupancy vehicles, citizens may experience reduced congestion and pollution as well as improved health, cost savings and social connections. A balance of transportation options benefits all.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Car usage has long been associated with middle-class suburban life, but recent trends and initiatives are challenging this notion. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning techniques, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these communities are not only contributing to environmental sustainability but also improving the quality of life for their residents.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing car-free zones, like the ones in Vauban and Paris, these communities are actively combating air pollution. The success of these measures is evident in the significant decrease in congestion and smog levels. For example, Paris experienced a 60 percent reduction in congestion after enforcing a driving ban due to smog.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for instance, has embraced a low-car suburban lifestyle, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of this community rely on public transportation and bicycles to commute, which not only reduces their carbon footprint but also improves their overall well-being. Car-free days, like the one in Bogota, are becoming more popular worldwide, encouraging millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. These events play a crucial role in shifting people's behavior towards more sustainable transportation options.

Body Paragraph 3:
In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing space for parking, suburbs can become less dependent on cars. This approach not only reduces traffic congestion and allows for a more efficient use of space but also fosters a sense of community. In Vauban, the absence of cars has resulted in verdant streets where people can freely walk and children can play without the constant noise and pollution associated with vehicular traffic.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in various communities worldwide. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of alternative transportation, and creation of more compact and accessible neighborhoods are all contributing to a more sustainable and fulfilling way of life. As more people embrace these initiatives, the car culture that has dominated suburban areas for decades may soon be a thing of the past. By prioritizing the environment and prioritizing the community, we can create a future that is not dependent on cars and is focused on the well-being of its residents.",1
"I do not possess personal beliefs or positions that would enable me to argue in favour or against the development of driverless cars. however, based on the details provided in the prompt, i can create a general argumentative essay.


introduction:
the emergence of driverless cars has sparked a debate about their development. while there are some benefits to this technology, concerns have surfaced regarding their reliability and ethical implications. in this essay, i will provide an analysis of the arguments presented in ""driverless cars are coming,"" and argue against the development of these cars.

body:

one of the major concerns regarding driverless cars is their ability to operate safely in unexpected and unpredictable situations. in the article, the author notes that the technology is still in development, with some cars being involved in accidents. for instance, in march 2018, an uber driverless car struck and killed a pedestrian. the incident highlighted the potential hazards of driverless cars, as they may not be able to recognize or interpret complex situations.

another concern is the potential job loss for drivers that would result from the widespread use of driverless cars. many industries rely on human drivers, such as taxi companies, trucking companies, and delivery services. the implementation of driverless cars would result in significant unemployment across many sectors. this would have a severe economic impact, particularly on low-skilled workers that would find it difficult to secure employment.

additionally, the development of this technology raises ethical considerations that have yet to be fully addressed. for example, in the event of an accident, who would be held responsible? would it be the car manufacturer or the software developer? this question remains unanswered, and the lack of ethical guidelines could pose a significant risk.

finally, the cost of driverless cars is likely to be high, and it is unclear who would foot the bill. while car manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of this technology, it is uncertain whether these cars will become affordable for the average individual.

conclusion:
based on the arguments presented, i believe that driverless cars should not be developed further. the potential risks and ethical considerations outweigh any purported benefits. it is necessary to address these concerns before pursuing the development of driverless cars further. we should focus our efforts on improving existing transportation systems and reducing their environmental impact. this would have a positive impact on society, the economy and the environment.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system for electing the President of the United States. While it is true that there are arguments against the Electoral College, there are also several compelling reasons to retain this method.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. Despite the occasional dispute over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, the electoral vote winner generally aligns with the winner of the popular vote. This ensures that the candidate who receives the most support across various states is elected as President. The winner-take-all system in most states helps to create a landslide victory for the winning candidate, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""Everyone's President."" With its requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system prevents a candidate with only regional favor from being elected. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign across different regions, thereby representing the interests of a diverse range of constituents. It ensures that no particular region has an undue influence over the election outcome, fostering a sense of inclusivity among voters.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. The winner-take-all approach encourages candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. By doing so, they engage voters in those states more effectively, leading to higher voter participation and informed decision-making. Furthermore, swing states are more likely to have the most thoughtful voters who closely follow the campaign and have a substantial impact on the election result.

The Electoral College also serves to balance the power between large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on population, it presents an opportunity for states with larger populations to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This prevents lesser-populated states from being neglected or overshadowed, ensuring that their voices are heard during the campaign and considered in the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This feature provides for a clear and decisive winner, preventing extended and potentially contentious election processes. The Electoral College has consistently produced a definitive outcome, which helps to maintain stability and efficiency in the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the high voter turnout in recent elections suggests otherwise. Many voters recognize the importance of expressing their political preferences, regardless of the potential impact on the national election. Moreover, the Electoral College serves as a safeguard against the potential influence of a few swing voters in determining the fate of the presidency, ensuring a more balanced and representative outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides several practical reasons for its retention. Its inherent advantages, such as certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections, make it a sensible and efficient method for electing the President. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on the future of this system.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear State Senator,

I am writting to you today to express my opion on the electoral colledge. I believe that we should keep the electoral colledge the way it is. I know that some people think that it is unfair and that we should have a popular vote system. But I think that the electoral colledge is fair and here's why.

First of all, the electoral colledge makes sure that smaller states have a voice. If we had a popular vote system, then the bigger states with more people would have all the power. The smaller states would be ignored and their intrests would not be represented. But with the electoral colledge, each state has a certain number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is. This means that presidential canidates have to pay attention to all states, not just the big ones.

Second, the electoral colledge prevents a tyranny of the majority. This means that if one party or canidate has a majority of the votes, they can't just force their will on the minority. With the electoral colledge, the president has to win a majority of the electoral votes, which means that they have to have support from a broad range of people, not just one group.

Finally, the electoral colledge has been a part of our country's history for over 200 years. It was set up by the founding fathers and has been used in every presidential election since the begining. Changing it now would be a big mistake. It would be unfair to all the people who have used the electoral colledge in the past.

I know that some people say that the electoral colledge is undemocratic, but I don't think that's true. It's actually very democratic because it gives each state an equal say in the election. It's not just about the number of people, it's about the number of states. And each state has an equal number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is.

I hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the electoral colledge the way it is. Thank you for your time and consiteration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"While the mysterious features of the Cydonia region's ""Face on Mars"" formation have captured people's imaginations and led some to believe it was created by extraterrestrial beings, scientific evidence points to the Face being a completely natural landform. Several key facts support this conclusion.

The article provides compelling evidence that the Face is simply a trick of light and shadow rather than an actual engineered structure. When photos of the Face were enhanced to bring out details, it became apparent that the supposed features were just random bumps and cavities in the martian terrain. No discernible edges or symmetry that would indicate artificial construction could be found. Furthermore, other puzzling landforms in the same region, such as the ""D&M Pyramid,"" dissolved into unremarkable hills and mesas under enhanced imaging. This suggests all the unusual features are natural rock outcroppings that only take on visual resemblance to human artifacts from certain angles and lighting. 

Additional support comes from photos of other eroded mesas and plateaus on Mars that have an uncanny resemblance to human profiles or objects. Nature is capable of accidentally sculpting eye-like craters and nose-shaped formations purely through natural weathering and erosion over millions of years. With countless natural formations spread across the planet, it seems inevitable that some random cluster of rocks would happen to vaguely resemble a human face when viewed from the right vantage point, without requiring engineering. 

Finally, there is no evidence that Mars could ever have supported life capable of building a structure like the supposed ""Face."" The environmental conditions have always been far too hostile for complex organisms to evolve, with no oxygen, liquid water or protective magnetic field. Assuming the Face is artificial would require believing Martians constructed it despite this and then somehow vanished without leaving behind any other artifacts or installations. The lack of corroborating evidence makes such a scenario highly improbable compared to the simple geological processes that could sculpt something superficially face-like.

In conclusion, while speculation about the Face on Mars captures people's sense of wonder about life beyond Earth, scientific investigation demonstrates it is virtually certain the formation was crafted solely by natural forces, not aliens. The preponderance of evidence weighs heavily in favor of a mundane geological origin over an engineered structure. Unless compelling new data emerges, we must accept the Face is just a trick of light and shadow playing on our minds.",1
"While studying Venus presents clear dangers due to its extreme environment, the author makes a compelling case that such exploration is nonetheless a worthy pursuit. The key evidence provided supports this claim.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence the author provides is the sheer scientific value that can be gained from studying Venus. As Earth's sister planet, Venus holds clues that can help scientists better understand planetary evolution and the possibilities for life elsewhere in the universe. Venus presents an opportunity to gain valuable insights into atmospheric chemistry, volcanism, climate change, and other planetary processes. This potential for scientific discovery is incredibly valuable, particularly as humanity looks to expand its understanding of our solar system and beyond. 

Further evidence presented is Venus's potential similarity to Earth in its earliest years. The author notes Venus may have once had liquid water on its surface before a runaway greenhouse effect transformed the planet. Studying Venus up close could thus yield new understandings of Earth's own early history and climate. With concerns growing over climate change effects here on Earth, the parallels to and lessons from Venus's climate transformation are hugely significant from a scientific perspective.

While the extreme heat, toxic atmosphere, and lack of surface accessibility on Venus present undeniable challenges and dangers, the author makes a persuasive case that the potential scientific rewards of exploring this planet outweigh these risks. From gaining new knowledge applicable to climate science and the search for life elsewhere, to illuminating planetary evolution and early Earth, the scientific value of Venus studies is immense according to the evidence presented. In this way, the author provides strong support for the assertion that studying Venus remains a worthy pursuit despite its difficulties. The profound scientific insights to be gained, as evidenced in the article, demonstrate why continuing exploration of our closest planetary neighbor is so important.",1
"Participating in Adventure: How the Seagoing Cowboys Enriched My Life

Growing up on a ranch in Colorado, my life revolved around caring for cattle and feeling tied to the same landscape. When I heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, offering to take skilled ranch hands offshore to help with marine research, I was instantly intrigued by the opportunity to experience new places. Reflecting on my time spent with the Seagoing Cowboys, I have found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life that I would happily recommend to others.  

During my voyage, I assisted scientists with tagging sharks and collecting water samples in the Gulf of Mexico. Being out at sea on a research vessel felt vastly different than life on my family's ranch, yet I drew upon many of the same skills - like working as part of a team, dealing with unpredictable conditions, and solving problems on the fly. Most remarkably, I visited coastal regions like Florida and Texas that I otherwise may never have seen. Working with marine life was also a completely new experience that allowed me to expand my expertise. 

Not only was I challenged in ways that helped me grow both professionally and personally, but I also developed lifelong friendships with the other Seagoing Cowboys and researchers aboard. We bonded over long workdays and achieving successes together as a crew. The program also opened my eyes to possible future career paths combining agriculture and ocean conservation that I am now pursuing further education for. 

If given the opportunity, I strongly encourage others to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Beyond getting to experience adventures most only dream of, you will get hands-on career training while making memories that will last a lifetime. Though I miss the wide-open landscapes of home, participating in this program enriched my life in ways I never could have imagined. For anyone seeking an enriched perspective and rewarding personal growth, time spent as a Seagoing Cowboy promises lasting value.",1
"Cars are one of the most important and common modes of transportation that exist in the world today. Almost everyone owns a car or has access to one. However, the over-reliance on cars is causing several negative impacts on the environment and our health. It is, therefore, crucial that people limit their car usage to enjoy the benefits that come with it. There are several advantages of limiting car usage that people should be aware of.

The first advantage of reducing car usage is that it helps to reduce the amount of pollution that cars emit into the air. According to the National Geographic Society, the exhaust fumes from vehicles contain harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. These gases are dangerous to our health and can cause respiratory problems, such as asthma, as well as other health issues. Reducing car usage means that fewer cars will emit these gases, and therefore, fewer people will suffer from the negative effects of air pollution.

The second advantage of limiting car usage is that it helps to reduce traffic congestion. As more and more people rely on cars for transportation, the number of cars on the road also increases, leading to traffic congestion. Congestion not only causes frustration and delays but also increases fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Limiting car usage means that there will be fewer cars on the road, which will help to reduce congestion and the associated negative impacts.

The third advantage of reducing car usage is that it helps to promote physical activity. When people choose to walk, cycle or use public transportation, they engage in physical activity which is essential for good health. Walking and cycling can also be an enjoyable way to travel and can reduce stress levels.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting physical activity. It is, therefore, important that people consider alternative modes of transportation that are not only environmentally friendly but also good for their health. It is up to all of us to make the necessary changes and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.",1
"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my strong belief in the value and importance of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that maintaining the Electoral College system would be in the best interest of our nation for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College is a crucial part of our constitutional framework. Established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, it ensures that each state has a voice in the election process. As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."" This means that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger ones, and each state has a fair say in choosing the President.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. According to Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps avoid potential disputes and ensures a clear winner. The winner-takes-all method employed by most states gives a candidate an overwhelming majority if they secure even a slight plurality in a state. This reflects the will of the people in that state and avoids the possibility of a tie or a close election leading to a confusing run-off.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system promotes a president with trans-regional appeal. In a direct popular vote system, candidates could focus solely on heavily populated regions and neglect the interests of less populous areas. As Judge Posner explains, ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president."" The Electoral College, by requiring candidates to win a majority of electoral votes from various regions, encourages them to campaign broadly and address the concerns and needs of citizens across the nation.

The Electoral College also gives swing states a significant role in the election process. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner highlights that candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where victory or loss is uncertain. This encourages voters in swing states to pay close attention to the campaign, examine candidates' policies, and make an informed decision. The electoral votes awarded by these states often determine the outcome of the election, ensuring that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a substantial say in choosing our president.

Lastly, the Electoral College safeguards the political balance among states, particularly large ones. As Judge Posner notes, the Electoral College gives more weight to larger states, allowing candidates to provide adequate attention and representation to these states. This balances out the mal-apportionment of the Senate and prevents smaller states from being overshadowed in the political process.

While it is true that some argue for abolishing the Electoral College and adopting a direct popular vote system, it is essential to critically examine the consequences of such a change. Direct elections might lead to an imbalance in the political power of different regions, create the possibility of run-off elections, and diminish the voices of smaller states. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that the president is chosen by a broad range of voters and represents the interests of diverse states across the country.

In conclusion, I strongly support retaining the Electoral College in order to maintain the balance of power and ensure that each state has a meaningful role in choosing our President. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to have broad trans-regional appeal, empowers swing states, and restores the weight of large states in the political process. I urge you to consider these arguments as you deliberate on this important matter.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will make decisions that serve the best interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the Electoral College should be kept as the method for electing the President of the United States. While popular vote seems like a more straightforward system, replacing the Electoral College could have unintended consequences that weaken our democratic process.

One argument made for switching to a popular vote is that it would make every voter count equally. However, the Electoral College was designed to balance both national and regional interests. Smaller states could become less influential in national politics if presidential candidates only campaigned in large population centers. This could reduce civic participation across the country. The current system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and consider a wider range of issues. 

It is also important to consider that abolishing the Electoral College could encourage the rise of regional parties. Without the constraints of a nationwide majority, candidates may focus only on regional strongholds. This could weaken our two-party system and make it more difficult for any candidate to gather support from a true nationwide consensus. fragmented national politics may produce less moderate leadership.

While concerns have been raised about how the Electoral College has functioned in some recent elections, it is unclear that replacing it would solve those concerns in a way that strengthens our democracy. Small changes like awarding electoral votes proportionally in each state could help address some criticisms without abandoning our existing democratic processes entirely. Overall, the stability and broad approach encouraged by the Electoral College system has served our country well for many years. For these reasons, I believe it would be premature to abandon this system at this time.

Thank you for considering my perspective. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

"Hi, my name is Jill and I am a scietist at NASA. I am here to tell you all about the face on Mars. Some people say it was made by aliens but let me tell you, it is just a natral landform.

First off, the face is not even a face. It's just a mounatin that has some features that look a little like eyes and a nose. But, if you look at it from a different angel, it does not look like a face atall. This means that it's just a trick of the eye and not a real face.

Now, the artical we read says that the face is made up of a bunch of difrent rocks. This proves that it's not a face because if it was a real face, it would be made out of the same kind of rock. Also, the rocks that make up the face are all diffrent shapes and sizes. This means that the face is not even a real thing! 

Another thing that proves the face is not a face is that there is a big ol' hole in the side of it. If a alien was gonna make a face, they would not put a big ol' hole in it. It would ruin the efect!

Finally, the artical says that scientists have studied the face on Mars for along time and they can't find any signs that it was made by aliens. This means that all the peoples who say it was made by aliens are just pretending. They don't know what they are talking about.

In conlusion, the face on Mars is not a face at all. It's just a mounatin that looks a little like a face if you look at it in the righ angle. It's made up of difrent kinds of rocks, there's a big hole in it, and scientists have found no signs that it was made by aliens.  So, the next time you here someone talking abour the face on Mars, you can tell them it's just natral!",1
"While driverless cars offer many potential benefits, I have reservations about fully implementing this new technology. According to the article, driverless cars could reduce accidents caused by human error, freeing up time spent commuting, and providing mobility for disabled individuals. However, the technology also raises privacy concerns and may negatively impact the transportation job market.  

One benefit the article discusses is reduced accidents, as computers eliminate human errors like distracted driving or driving under the influence. Proponents argue driverless cars could follow traffic laws perfectly and avoid 90% of crashes. However, the technology is still being developed and tested. Unintended consequences are difficult to predict, and bugs or hacking could potentially put lives at risk until the technology is proven safe. Additionally, while accidents may decrease on roads with driverless cars, human drivers would still be present. Computers would need to safely navigate unpredictable human judgments.  

A second advantage presented is increased productivity and convenience, as commuters could work, read or sleep instead of focusing on the road. However, some value personal control and enjoyment of driving itself. Access to mobility for those unable to drive independently could help many but replacing all transportation jobs overnight would significantly impact limousine drivers, taxi and rideshare workers, and truck drivers. Replacing so many jobs could shock the labor market, especially in areas dependent on transportation jobs, unless new jobs are also created. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars show promise in reducing accidents and increasing accessibility and productivity, fully implementing the technology also carries risks that have yet to be addressed. More research and testing is needed to prove the technology is consistently safe under varied conditions before relying on computers alone for transportation. A balanced approach that slowly integrates driverless features while still allowing human control could help maximize benefits and limit potential downsides as the technology continues advancing. Overall, driverless cars require further development and oversight to ensure safety remains the highest priority as this new technology changes transportation.",1
"Hey, I know you think the Face on Mars is like this super cool sign of alien life and all, but let me tell you, it's just not that exciting. I mean, sure, it looks kinda like a face, but that's just because our brains are wired to see patterns and stuff. It's like when you see a picture of a dog in the clouds - it's not actually a dog, it's just clouds. Same thing with the Face on Mars.

First of all, let's talk about how the Face was even discovered. It was like, way back in the 70s, when some dude named Viking Orbiter took a picture of Mars and people were like 'oh my gosh, it's a face!' But then, when they took a closer look, they realized it wasn't actually a face at all. It was just a bunch of mountains and valleys that happened to look like a face from really far away. I mean, come on, have you ever seen a mountain that looks like a face? It's not that rare, guys.

And then there's the whole thing about the Face being a sign of alien life. Like, hello, if there was really an alien civilization on Mars, don't you think we would have found way more evidence of it by now? I mean, we've been studying Mars for ages, and we've found like, a bunch of rocks and some ice. That's it. No aliens, no fancy buildings, no nothing. Just rocks and ice.

Plus, the Face is like, really small compared to the rest of Mars. It's like, a tiny little mountain range in the middle of this huge planet. If aliens really wanted to communicate with us, don't you think they would have built something a bit bigger? Something we could actually see from Earth, instead of having to send a spacecraft all the way to Mars to find it? It just doesn't make sense, guys.

So yeah, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not some super cool sign of alien life. It's just a natural landform that happens to look like a face from really far away. Let's not get our hopes up, okay? We'll find alien life someday, I'm sure, but it's not gonna be on Mars, and it's not gonna look like a face.

"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology in classrooms has benefits but also raises important privacy concerns. On one hand, this technology could help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling and if they are engaged or struggling. Identifying emotions like boredom, confusion or frustration could allow teachers to adjust their lessons to better meet student needs. This type of data may also provide valuable feedback to teachers on their own effectiveness and ways to improve instruction. 

However, this technology also represents an intrusion on student privacy. Continuously monitoring facial expressions and emotions is akin to surveillance and could make some students feel uncomfortable or restricted in the classroom. Students should feel free to express a range of emotions naturally without everything being analyzed and tracked. There are also risks if emotional data is collected, stored and possibly shared without appropriate safeguards. If not handled carefully, such sensitive personal information could be misused or leaked, negatively impacting students.

Overall, while FACS technology offers potential benefits to teaching and learning, its use in classrooms also raises justifiable concerns about privacy, monitoring and data protection. Strict guidelines would need to be established and followed to ensure student consent, privacy, data security and appropriate limitations on how emotional readings are collected and applied. Unless these types of protections are in place, the risks of invasive monitoring may outweigh the prospective value of gaining emotional insights through this new technology. More discussion is needed between all stakeholders to determine how or if FACS could be implemented ethically in an educational setting.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for [insert your position] in regards to the Electoral College. As a student in grade 7, I have learned about our nation's history and the importance of our democratic institutions, such as the Electoral College.

The Electoral College has been a part of our nation's history since its formation, and it has played an essential role in ensuring that every state, regardless of its size, has an equal voice in the presidential elections. This system has allowed smaller states to have a significant impact on the election outcome, and it has ensured that presidential candidates pay attention to all states, not just the most populous ones.

Furthermore, the Electoral College has helped to prevent fraud and corruption in presidential elections. In a direct popular vote system, there would be a greater risk of voter fraud and manipulation of the results in highly populated areas. The Electoral College, on the other hand, distributes the power and influence of the vote, ensuring that no one state or group of people has an unfair advantage.

However, some may argue that the Electoral College is outdated and should be replaced with a popular vote system. They may claim that a direct popular vote would ensure that every citizen's vote counts and would eliminate the potential for fraud or corruption.

While I understand their concerns, I strongly believe that the potential risks of a direct popular vote system far outweigh any perceived benefits. The Electoral College has been a crucial part of our nation's democracy for over two centuries, and it has served us well.

In conclusion, I urge you to support [insert your position] in regards to the Electoral College. This system has been a vital component of our democratic process, and it is crucial that we maintain this tradition. Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective, and I look forward to your response.

"While some believe the Face on Mars is evidence of ancient aliens, the facts tell a different story. As a scientist at NASA who has studied this landmark extensively, I can explain that the Face is simply a natural landform formed through normal geological processes over millions of years. 

Many initial observations of the Face seemed to suggest artificial, or designed, elements. It appeared symmetrical from above with obvious eye and mouth-like features. However, upon closer examination, what appeared symmetrical is actually quite asymmetrical. The ""eyes"" and ""mouth"" are of uneven sizes and shape. Natural formations often take on pareidolic, or face-like, appearances without being intentionally designed. 

Scientists have also taken core samples from the area to analyze the geological layers and composition. The results show the Face is comprised of the same scree slopes and bedrock common across the Cydonia region of Mars. Infrared images further prove the material making up the Face is identical to the surrounding terrain. If it were artificially constructed, one would expect to see different materials used. 

Erosion over eons best explains the formation of what can initially appear to be a designed shape. Wind has sculpted away at the landscape, hollowing out sheltered areas below steep slopes to form overhangs that project faces into space photos. Changing temperatures and seasons exacerbate this natural weathering process. Given enough time, even random patterns in rock can take on misleading iconic forms through erosion alone. 

With evidence the Face on Mars consists of ordinary geological strata and demonstrates patterns of natural weathering common across the planet, the most logical conclusion is that it too was formed through normal geological activity rather than alien intervention. While some might prefer more exciting explanations, as scientists we must follow the facts, and in this case they point to a natural rather than an artificial origin for this Martian landmark.",1
"Limiting Car Usage to Improve Quality of Life

There are significant advantages to limiting car usage through policies that promote public transportation, biking, and walking. Reliance on vehicles for most trips negatively impacts both individual and community well-being. Transitioning toward more sustainable transportation options can enhance quality of life in several important ways.

One major benefit is improved public health. When cars are used less frequently for short trips, people are more likely to incorporate physical activity like biking or walking into their daily routines. This can help combat issues like obesity, heart disease, and other health problems linked to sedentary lifestyles. Less time spent driving also means less exposure to air pollution from vehicle emissions. Poor air quality is a known risk factor for respiratory illnesses. Shifting modes of transportation to those powered by human energy rather than fossil fuels leads to healthier residents.

In addition to individual physical fitness, less car-centric infrastructure and policies are better for community mental health and social cohesion. Public spaces become more welcoming for socializing when not dominated by car traffic. Neighborhoods with more walkers and bikers report higher levels of social capital as people are more likely to interact. Children gain independence by safely accessing activities like visiting friends through active transportation instead of being driven everywhere. The elderly can age in place for longer when alternates to driving are convenient. Overall, alternative transit builds stronger, more connected communities.  

Finally, limiting car usage benefits the environment and financial well-being. Fewer vehicles means reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This alleviates impacts of climate change for future generations. Money once spent on private car expenses like insurance, gas, and repairs can be put toward other priorities. In the long run, mass transit infrastructure requires fewer taxpayer subsidies than road maintenance and new highway projects. Transitioning away from car dependency improves ecological and economic sustainability at both individual household and public policy levels.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage include enhanced public health, stronger communities, and environmental/economic benefits. By promoting transit options that replace short car trips, citizens can enjoy an improved quality of life while achieving more sustainable transportation system for years to come. Policymakers should incentivize lifestyle changes through investments in infrastructure that supports safe biking, walking, and public transportation. The overall well-being of communities depends on adopting practices that reduce dependence on private vehicles.",1
"Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States' presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers several benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3% of the popular vote. This indicates that the Electoral College aligns the interests of the states and prevents a few densely populated areas from dominating the entire election process. With the current system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear result and avoiding disputes over the outcome.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate cannot rely solely on the support of one particular region and must consider the interests of the entire nation. This ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs and concerns of citizens from different regions, preventing a ""regional favorite"" from neglecting the interests of other parts of the country.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Swing states play a crucial role in election outcomes as they receive the most attention and information from candidates, resulting in more thoughtful and informed voters. This system ensures that candidates have a genuine interest in engaging with and addressing the concerns of swing state voters, ultimately improving the overall quality of the campaign.

The Electoral College also preserves the weight of larger states in the political balance. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. By considering both population and state size, the Electoral College balances the representation of both large and small states. This way, presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to the needs and concerns of both populous states like Florida and smaller states like Wyoming, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for complicated run-off elections. Under this system, a candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the clear winner, eliminating the need for further rounds of voting. This prevents political instability and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the numbers from the 2012 election indicate that eligible American voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the impact on the national outcome. The Electoral College system has not hindered citizen participation in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several advantages that promote a fair and balanced presidential election. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system in our country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The passage set provides examples from various parts of the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing reliance on cars.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, a town in Germany, serves as an excellent example of this. With the majority of families not owning cars, the streets are car-free, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent.

Limiting car usage also has health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can have adverse effects on human health. The smog in Paris, for instance, rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing car usage, the air quality improves, reducing respiratory problems and other health issues. Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event has been successful in changing people's behavior and has been replicated in other cities as well.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the opportunity for more compact and accessible communities. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, which has led to increased traffic congestion and sprawling developments. However, efforts are being made to create suburban areas that prioritize public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Vauban in Germany is a prime example of this approach, where stores are located within walking distance on a main street, reducing the need for long car journeys to shopping malls.

Reducing car usage can also have economic benefits. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, highlighting the reliance on cars for certain businesses. However, by shifting to alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or public transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs.

Overall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible communities and promoting healthier lifestyles. While the transition may require changes in infrastructure and individual habits, the benefits to both individuals and the environment make it a worthwhile endeavor.",1
"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom is problematic and an invasion of privacy. While identifying students' emotions could provide teachers insights to better engage students, this type of monitoring also raises serious ethical concerns. 

On one hand, the technology aims to help teachers understand how their lessons are landing with students on an emotional level. Knowing when students appear bored, confused or frustrated could help teachers adapt their instruction in real-time to improve engagement and learning outcomes. Proponents might argue this leads to a more personalized education.

However, constantly monitoring students' facial expressions and private emotions without their consent crosses an important line. In the classroom, students should feel free to naturally experience a full range of reactions without fearing a computer system is over-analyzing every micro-expression. Emotions are complex and personal, and automatic classification by an algorithm may misconstrue true feelings or lack important context about individuals.

Additionally, using this type of surveillance could undermine the student-teacher relationship built on trust. Students may feel less comfortable openly expressing themselves if they know a computer is reporting details about their emotional state back to teachers and administrators. Over time, this lack of privacy could negatively impact psychological development and well-being. 

In balancing the potential benefits with serious risks to student privacy and development, the downsides of conducting ongoing computerized emotional surveillance in the classroom seem to outweigh the advantages. While technology that provides insights to improve teaching has merit, reading students' private emotions without consent goes too far. Schools should pursue alternatives that respect student privacy and allow natural human relationships in the learning process to thrive. Overall, the concerns about students' well-being and rights outweigh using this technology without meaningful consent in the classroom setting.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While changing to a popular vote system may seem like a more straightforward democratic process, I believe the Electoral College helps protect against some of the limitations of a popular vote.

One concern about a popular vote is that candidates would only campaign and spend resources in a few densely populated metropolitan areas. This could drown out the voices of more rural states and communities. The Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and consider the interests of a more geographically diverse range of voters. It helps ensure that smaller states still feel represented in presidential elections. 

However, some argue the Electoral College can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. While this has happened only a few times, it is certainly problematic for perceptions of democratic legitimacy. But rather than abolishing the whole system, reforms could help address this issue. For example, awarding electoral votes proportionally based on congressional districts, rather than winner-take-all, could help the electoral vote outcome better match the popular vote in each state.

In the end, no system is perfect, but on balance the Electoral College fosters broader geographic representation and encourages candidates to build broader appeal. With some moderate reforms, it could better reflect the national popular vote as well. For these reasons, I believe we should keep the Electoral College rather than change to a popular vote system. Let me know if you have any other questions on my perspective on this important issue.

"The Development of Driverless Cars

While driverless cars present many prospective benefits, there are also feasible risks to consider regarding their widespread adoption. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", autonomous vehicles could potentially decrease accident rates and traffic congestion. However, the technology is still maturing and may introduce unforeseen safety hazards. On balance, more research and testing is needed before fully driverless cars proliferate on public roads.

One advantage cited is that removing the human element from driving could save thousands of lives lost annually to traffic collisions stemming from human error or oversight. Without drivers to become distracted, tired, drunk or otherwise impaired behind the wheel, these AI-driven cars could make streets safer. At the same time though, the article notes sensors and software may have limitations that hackers could potentially exploit to endanger passengers. Glitches may also occur that designers did not anticipate which could confuse or overwhelm these artificial transport systems.  

While proponents argue autonomous vehicles could improve mobility for the disabled, elderly, or young; it remains uncertain how well cars could handle rare or unexpected scenarios. Although manufacturers are striving to eliminate accidents, computers are still rule-following robots without human-level judgment or flexibility. Before self-operating vehicles share the road extensively with human drivers, more testing in varied conditions is advisable to reveal potential issues. The impacts of integrating these vehicles also warrants examination through comprehensive pilot programs and public dialogue.

In conclusion, driverless cars offer promising benefits but also involve foreseeable risks that require further scrutiny before widespread deployment. While the goal of safer transportation through emerging technology is admirable, more research and testing is prudent to help ensure public safety as this innovation progresses. At present, autonomous vehicles seem best reserved to regulated pilots while human oversight remains standard. With adequate time for refining limitations and unforeseen hazards, driverless cars may one day complement rather than compete with human drivers on public roads.",1
"In Support of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the selection of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves a crucial role in our presidential elections. In making this argument, I will address the criticisms of the Electoral College and present evidence from multiple sources to support my claims.

One of the primary arguments against the Electoral College is its lack of democratic principles. Critics argue that the winner-take-all system in each state leads to candidates focusing only on swing states, thereby ignoring the interests of other states and voters. However, Judge Richard A. Posner contends that the Electoral College ensures that a candidate has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must work to gain support from various regions of the country. This requirement fosters a sense of national representation and prevents candidates from solely catering to specific regions. As a result, the Electoral College promotes a more united and balanced approach to campaigning.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to focus their campaigns on swing states. According to Judge Posner, voters in these toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions regarding their vote. This dynamic ensures that those who invest effort into understanding the candidates and their policies have a greater impact on the outcome of the election. Ultimately, this system promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College addresses the concern of smaller states having less influence in the election. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some political balance by giving weighted attention to larger states. This system ensures that candidates cannot overlook the concerns and interests of states with smaller populations. By granting electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the Electoral College values the diverse perspectives of both large and small states.

Critics of the Electoral College also argue that it can result in an outcome where the popular vote winner does not win the presidency. It is important to note, however, that such instances have been rare throughout history. The Office of the Federal Register outlines that since 1888, there has only been one such occurrence, which happened in 2000. Furthermore, the Electoral College provides certainty in the outcome, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote due to winner-take-all rules. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital mechanism in our democracy to elect the President of the United States. It ensures trans-regional appeal, encourages campaigns to focus on swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and reduces the need for run-off elections. While some have criticized the system, the evidence from multiple sources, including the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, emphasizes the benefits and practicality of the Electoral College.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I urge you to continue supporting the Electoral College, which safeguards the interests of all states and voters in our nation.

Sincerely,

"The use of facial recognition technology in classrooms like the Facial Action Coding System described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" could potentially provide both benefits and risks when it comes to reading students' emotional expressions. 

One potential benefit is that teachers may gain valuable insight into how their lessons are affecting students. If the technology can accurately identify when students appear bored, confused, or frustrated, teachers could adjust their teaching methods to better engage students and ensure they are grasping the material. This kind of feedback in real-time could help teachers continuously improve and meet the learning needs of all students.

However, there are also some risks to consider. Continuous monitoring of students' facial expressions may invade their privacy and make them feel uncomfortable or restricted in the classroom. Students should feel free to naturally express a range of emotions like confusion as they work through challenging concepts. Constant tracking could hamper their ability to freely explore ideas and think creatively. Additionally, facial recognition technology is still an developing field and may not always accurately interpret students' emotions, leading teachers to potentially make incorrect assumptions. 

Overall, while facial recognition aimed at improving education has merit, more research is needed to ensure students' privacy and right to a safe learning environment are not jeopardized. Any use of this technology would require extensive oversight, opportunities for student input, and safeguards to address issues of consent, data protection and potential misinterpretations. Only with proper precautions in place could facial analysis technology perhaps provide value in a classroom setting, but the risks must not be taken lightly. The benefits would need to strongly outweigh any disadvantages to students' learning experience and well-being.",1

"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. Firstly, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases into the environment which can have negative effects on our health. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in our cities and improve the air quality for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, there are too many cars on the road, which leads to traffic jams and long commuting times. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to use public transportation or to cycle or walk instead, which can help to reduce traffic and make commuting faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Cars are one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels, and as these resources become scarcer, we need to find alternative ways to fuel our transportation needs. By reducing car usage, we can encourage the development of alternative transportation options, such as electric cars or public transportation powered by renewable energy.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reducing air pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. As citizens, we have a responsibility to take action to address these issues and create more sustainable communities. This can start with small changes, such as using public transportation or cycling instead of driving, and can ultimately lead to significant improvements in our environment and quality of life.",1
"Introduction:

Hey there! So you think that the Face on Mars is like, totally created by aliens? Like, come on! That's so cool! But like, actually, it's not. It's just a natural landform. Yeah, I know, it looks all fancy and stuff, but trust me, it's not as exciting as it seems.

Body:

First of all, like, let's talk about how the Face was formed. According to the article, it was created by natural geological processes, like erosion and weathering. The article says that the Face is actually a ""mesa"" which is like, a flat-topped hill, and it was formed by the wind and water over millions of years. That's not something that aliens would do, right? I mean, why would they bother making a face on a planet that's like, billions of miles away? It doesn't make sense!

And secondly, like, the Face is not even that special. The article says that there are like, lots of other faces on Mars, but they're not as well-known as the one we're talking about. So, like, why would aliens only make one face? wouldn't they want to make like, a whole army of faces or something? And also, the Face is not even that detailed. It's just like, a few lines and curves. If aliens were gonna make a face, they would make it way more detailed and fancy, right?

Conclusion:

So yeah, like, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes. It's not that special and it doesn't make sense that aliens would make it. So, like, next time you look up at the sky and see Mars, remember, it's not a face made by aliens, it's just a rock!",1
"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Global Initiatives

In recent times, countries around the world have spearheaded campaigns to limit car usage as a strategic solution to combat environmental pollution and promote healthier living conditions. By examining the experiences of countries like Germany, France, and Colombia, we can identify several advantages of minimizing car usage, from environmental and health benefits to the positive influence on socioeconomic activities.

Firstly, reducing car usage significantly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, directly linked to cars. For example, in Vauban, a community in Germany, the pioneering implementation of a ""car-free"" residential subdivision saw a substantial decrease in car ownership (Rosenthal, 2009). This initiative has not only eliminated exhaust pollutants within the community's confines but also encouraged more eco-friendly modes of transportation, which could, in turn,help reduce global warming. 

Secondly, the reduction of car usage can dramatically improve urban air quality, manifest through the experiences of Paris and Bogotá. When Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to severe pollution, congestion reduced by 60 percent, seriously alleviating the smog issue plaguing the city (Duffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota's Car-Free Day led to a noticeable decrease in smog, contributing to less polluted and healthier environments for its residents(Selsky, 2002).

In addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also promote economic and social engagements in a community. The reduced need for parking spaces and driveways allows for more effective city planning, where public spaces and amenities can be maximized. Vauban's design, where stores and amenities are just a walk away, demonstrates this advantage(Rosenthal, 2009).

The inclination towards reducing car usage also aligns with a marked shift in societal behaviors. Recent studies suggest a decrease in the number of cars bought, miles driven, and fewer licenses applied for each year (Rosenthal, 2013). This decreasing interest in driving could lead to substantial benefits for the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of America's carbon emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). 

The advantages of limiting car usage are clear, and with the cultural shift away from dependency on personal vehicles, the future is likely to witness more car-free or car-reduced environments. As more cities around the world begin to adopt such environmental-friendly approaches, residents will reap the long-term benefits of cleaner air, lower noise pollution, more communal spaces, and a healthier planet.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing as a constituent and student to share my view on an essential part of our democratic process, the Electoral College. Given the diverse opinions that exist on this topic, I urge your consideration of both perspectives. 

The Electoral College, mandated by our founding fathers, facilitates a process of electing the President involving selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the counting of these votes by Congress (Office of the Federal Register). The intention was to form a bridge between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register).

However, the Electoral College is susceptible to complications. It has sometimes led to scenarios wherein the President-elect does not hold the majority of the popular vote (Plumer). An example of this is the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency (Plumer). A significant issue associated with the College is when electors defy the people's will (Plumer). 

Despite these instances, the rationale for retaining the Electoral College is strong. Judge Richard Posner outlines five practical reasons to maintain our current system: Certainty of Outcome, Everyone’s President, Swing States, Big States, and to Avoid Run-Off Elections (Posner). The necessity of the Electoral College's regional appeal, its attention to larger states, and the navigability around a majority-vote quandary provide a distinct and integral structure to our nation's electoral process. 

Without a doubt, the Electoral College is undemocratic by contemporary standards (Posner). Voters cast their ballots for electors rather than the Presidential candidate directly (Posner). Yet, the emphasis the College places on securing political balance and ensuring clear electoral outcomes validates its implications to our democratic system (Posner). However, the plight of potential voters in politically one-sided states, who feel their vote won’t sway their state’s majority, might lead to a decrease in voter turnout (Posner).

Therefore, although shifting to direct popular vote could provide a straightforward, every-vote-counts approach, the complexity of our nation requires the buffer that the Electoral College offers between pure popular sentiment and the selection of the President. Consider the implementation of a proportional system nationwide, similar to the one used by Maine and Nebraska, to address the issue of one-sided states and enhance the inclusivity provided by the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this critical matter. I believe we share the common goal of wanting a fair, effective process to elect the President of our beloved democracy. 

Sincerely,

"While driverless cars present opportunities, there are challenges worth addressing 

The development of driverless cars brings both promise and problems. On one hand, they could reduce accidents and free up time previously spent driving. Without human error, certain safety features may prevent collisions. And for those unable to drive, autonomous vehicles may provide valuable independence. At the same time, technological glitches could inadvertently cause harm. Public distrust may also arise. 

Rather than dismissing the idea outright, a balanced approach is needed. With further refinement, safety protocols could account for unexpected situations like construction zones. Lawmakers should establish guidelines to ensure accountability in case of malfunctions. Public education on automated vehicles' benefits could boost acceptance. For those still uncomfortable, conventional cars will likely remain an option.

Overall, the societal impacts of this technology deserve close consideration. If implemented prudently after addressing privacy, liability and technical issues, driverless cars may one day improve transportation. But rushing development risks undermining trust in autonomous vehicles before they realize their full potential. Careful testing and safeguards to address concerns will be key to gaining public support. With an open yet prudent mindset, many anticipated downsides could potentially be mitigated or avoided.  

In conclusion, while promising in many ways, driverless cars also present complex challenges. By acknowledging both opportunities and risks, and prioritizing safety through gradual change and oversight, this technology's development may one day enhance mobility for many in a responsible manner. But a measured, multipronged approach is prudent to ensure such impacts are realized.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and societies. As evident in the passage set, reducing car dependency can result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced congestion, and even positive cultural shifts. These benefits demonstrate the need to implement measures to limit car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can be as high as 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, emissions can be drastically decreased. For example, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free policy, leading to a decrease in car ownership and emissions. This shows that limiting car usage can play a crucial role in combating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Smog, a major environmental issue in bustling cities like Paris, can be significantly reduced by implementing driving bans. In Paris, a partial driving ban has successfully reduced congestion by 60 percent and improved air quality. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, or walking, cities can mitigate the negative impact of car emissions and improve the overall health of their residents.

Limiting car usage also helps alleviate congestion on the roads. The car-dependent nature of suburbs contributes to traffic congestion, especially during rush hours. By adopting the principles of ""smart planning,"" which prioritize public transportation and reduce space for parking, suburbs can become more compact and accessible. Vauban serves as an exemplary model, with its emphasis on walkable streets, proximity to stores, and limited parking spaces. Implementing similar practices in suburbs around the world can help reduce traffic congestion and create more livable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to positive cultural shifts and changes in behavior. The trend of reducing car ownership and driving less can have long-term implications for both the environment and the car industry. Research suggests that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift can benefit carbon emissions and the environment. Younger generations, in particular, are less interested in owning cars and prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, or using public transit. This change in behavior can have profound effects on urban planning and transportation systems.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has significant advantages for individuals and societies. Reducing car dependency can lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, alleviate congestion, and spark positive cultural shifts. By taking inspiration from successful models like Vauban, implementing driving bans like in Paris, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a society that is less dependent on cars.",1
"Driverless cars are a new technology that is being developed to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion. While some people see the benefits of these cars, others are concerned about their safety and impact on society. After reading the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” I believe that the development of driverless cars should be continued.

Firstly, driverless cars have the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article, driverless cars are programmed to follow traffic rules and avoid reckless behavior, such as speeding and tailgating. This means that they can prevent many of the accidents that are caused by human error. For example, in 2015, Google’s self-driving cars were involved in 17 accidents, but none of them were caused by the car itself. Instead, they were caused by human drivers who collided with the self-driving car. This shows that driverless cars are already safer than human-driven cars.

Secondly, driverless cars can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. The article states that driverless cars can travel closer together than human-driven cars, which can increase the number of cars on the road and reduce traffic jams. Additionally, driverless cars can adjust their speed to match the traffic conditions, which can further improve traffic flow. This means that driverless cars can help reduce the time spent in traffic, which can be beneficial for people who have long commutes to work or school.

Thirdly, driverless cars can provide greater mobility for people who are unable to drive. According to the article, driverless cars can be programmed to pick up people who are unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled. This means that these people can still have independence and mobility, which can improve their quality of life.

However, some people are concerned about the safety of driverless cars. They argue that the technology is still new and untested, and that there is a risk of the cars malfunctioning and causing accidents. While this is a valid concern, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. The article states that driverless cars are being tested extensively to ensure their safety, and that they are programmed to avoid accidents. Additionally, the cars are equipped with sensors and cameras that can detect potential hazards and take action to avoid them.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars should be continued. They have the potential to reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and provide greater mobility for people who are unable to drive. While there are concerns about their safety, I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. With further testing and development, driverless cars can become a safe and efficient mode of transportation for the future.",1
"Introduction:
Hey there! I'm super excited to share my thoughts on the Face on Mars with you. I know some people think it's this crazy alien structure, but let me tell you, it's actually just a natural landform! Yeah, I know, it sounds a little weird, but hear me out.

Body:
First off, let's talk about how the Face was formed. According to the article, it's actually just a bunch of hills and valleys that, when viewed from a certain angle, look like a face. It's called ""pareidolia,"" where our brains see patterns and shapes in random stuff. Like when you look at a cloud and see a rabbit or something. It's not actually a rabbit, it just looks like one!

But here's the cool part: the article says that the Face is actually a result of erosion! Yep, just like how rivers and wind can carve out rocks and stuff on Earth, the wind and ice on Mars did the same thing. It's like a natural sculpture! And the reason it looks so similar to a face is because, well, our brains are wired to recognize faces. It's like our brains are trying to make sense of this random stuff and they're like, ""Hey, that looks like a face!""

And don't even get me started on the ""alien"" stuff. I mean, come on, if aliens were gonna build a face on Mars, wouldn't they make it, like, way bigger? And wouldn't they want to make it look, you know, more alien-y? Like, with some weird tentacles or something? But no, the Face is just a bunch of hills and valleys that look like a face because of how the light hits it.

Evidence from the article that supports my claims:

* ""Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind perceives a familiar pattern or image where none exists."" (para. 2)
* ""The 'Face' is a result of erosion, created by the wind and ice that have ravaged the Martian surface over millions of years."" (para. 5)
* ""The Face is not a single structure, but rather a collection of hills and valleys that, when viewed from a certain angle, form a face-like feature."" (para. 7)

Conclusion:
So there you have it, folks! The Face on Mars is not some crazy alien structure, it's just a natural landform that our brains are interpreting as a face because of pareidolia. It's like a fun optical illusion, but on a much bigger scale! And honestly, I think it's way cooler that it's a natural part of Mars than if it were some alien thing. I mean, come on, we're talking about a planet here, not some little green men! 😜

I hope this essay helped convince you that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform and not some alien structure. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with! 😊",1
"I think driverless cars is a good idea. They will change the world. They will make it safer and easier for people to get around.

First, driverless cars will be safer. The article says that 90% of car crashes are caused by human error. That means that if we take humans out of the equation, we will have fewer accidents. Also, driverless cars will be able to communicate with each other and avoid crashes. For example, if a car is coming towards you, it can send a signal to your car and your car will brake automatically. This will save lives.

Second, driverless cars will be more convenient. People won’t have to worry about parking or traffic. They can just tell their car where they want to go and it will take them there. This will be especially helpful for people who are blind or disabled. They won’t have to rely on others to drive them around. They will have more independence.

Finally, driverless cars will help the environment. They will be electric, so they won’t produce any emissions. This will help reduce pollution and make the air cleaner. Also, people won’t need to own their own cars anymore. They can just call a driverless car when they need one. This will reduce the number of cars on the road and the amount of resources needed to make them.

In conclusion, driverless cars are the future. They will make our roads safer, our lives easier, and our planet cleaner. We should invest in this technology and make it available to everyone.",1
"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there have been calls for its abolition in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential purpose in our democracy. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, and it continues to ensure a fair and balanced representation of state interests in presidential elections.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. In the rare event of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of electoral votes tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes. The winner-take-all system in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different states. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming successful in a national election.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to focus campaign efforts on swing states. This helps to ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in these states, as they become crucial in deciding the outcome of the election. Voters in swing states are more likely to be informed and thoughtful in their decision-making process, as they know that their votes will have a significant impact.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives weight to larger states in the political balance. Although states are apportioned by population in the Senate, the Electoral College provides a counterbalance to the larger states' influence in presidential elections. This prevents smaller states from being neglected by candidates, as the Electoral College gives them a proportionate number of electoral votes based on their population.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for potentially complicated run-off elections. The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College ensures that a majority winner is produced, avoiding the need for second-round elections. This streamlines the election process and provides a clear and decisive result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy by ensuring that all states have a fair representation in the presidential election. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses efforts on swing states, balances the influence of larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in maintaining a fair and balanced electoral process.

I urge you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College system. It is a cornerstone of our democratic process and has served our nation well for over two centuries. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your continued dedication to upholding the values of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"The Face on Mars: A Natural Landform 

Many people view the famous ""Face on Mars"" as evidence of ancient alien visitation or structures on the red planet. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the Face is simply a result of natural geological forces. While intriguing at first glance, science provides compelling evidence that the formation was created through normal erosional processes rather than by intelligent design.

One of the key pieces of evidence that the Face is natural comes from higher resolution images captured by later Mars missions. These images revealed that the perceived ""features"" of the Face, such as eye sockets and a mouth, are merely darker and lighter patches that lose any clear definition at finer scales. The lines and contrast that give the illusion of a face become irregular and fragmented. If it were truly an artificial construct, we would expect the details to remain crisp and well-defined even at the closest observable levels. 

Additionally, landforms near the Face feature similar shading patterns that resemble faces when viewed from above. This implies that the discoloration results from natural weathering over varied rock layers and elevations. If the local terrain regularly develops accidental ""faces"", it strengthens the case that the celebrated Face is merely one more coincidence of nature. Scientists also point to regional geology like lava flows, fractures and wind erosion as the likely forces behind its present visual qualities.  

In conclusion, while an intriguing optical illusion, the preponderance of scientific evidence shows that the famous Face on Mars represents a chance resemble created over eons by normal geological processes on the red planet. Higher resolution images and analysis of the surrounding terrain provide compelling support that it is simply a naturally occurring landform rather than evidence of extraterrestrial construction or visitation. For these reasons, most space scientists remain confident that the Face is a trick of light and shadow on the natural, uneven Martian surface.",1
"While technology to identify human emotions could have benefits, using FACS monitoring of students in classrooms raises privacy and bias concerns that outweigh its value. 

FACS was created to advance scientific understanding of facial expressions and nonverbal cues. Its creators likely intended it to be used cautiously and ethically. Applying it to continuously monitor students risks invading their privacy and altering classroom dynamics in unforeseen ways. 

Students deserve a learning environment that feels safe and comfortable enough to take intellectual risks. Constant emotional surveillance could make students self-conscious and less willing to actively participate for fear of having their facial reactions analyzed and potentially judged. This might hinder creative and critical thinking. 

There is also the concern that FACS, while attempting to identify universal expressions, could reflect cultural biases in its programming. Different cultures and individuals express emotions in varied ways. What one algorithm reads as confusion, frustration or boredom may simply be another style of expression. Misreading facial cues could unfairly influence teachers' perceptions and evaluations of students.

Proponents argue FACS data could help teachers tailor lessons to better engage students. But teachers already draw on a variety of strategies and cues like students' questions, comments and assignment feedback to assess engagement. FACS risks becoming a shortcut or crutch that distracts from these human interactions. Its interpretations of fleeting micro-expressions could also be taken out of context or overemphasized relative to broader indicators of understanding. 

In some targeted research applications, FACS technology may prove useful when carefully designed protocols protect student privacy and prevent biases. But for regular classroom use, the drawbacks likely outweigh any benefits. Students' well-being and freedom to fully participate are better served with human relationships of trust between teachers and students, not constant electronic monitoring of emotional responses. Overall, FACS does not appear sufficiently developed or tested to warrant its values application for emotion surveillance in classrooms at this time.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

As a high school student studying American government, I feel compelled to express my thoughts on the upcoming presidential election and the role of the Electoral College in determining the winner. As an individual, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose in our democracy, and I am writing to urge you to support maintaining the Electoral College system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that presidential elections remain fair and representative across all states, regardless of each state's population. Without the Electoral College system, candidates would only campaign in highly populated states, ignoring the smaller states and their issues. In this way, the Electoral College promotes fairness, as it gives equal weight to each state's electoral votes, regardless of their population size.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents the tyranny of the majority by requiring a candidate to win a broad majority of states to become president. It is a critical safeguard against a candidate winning the popular vote while ignoring the needs of smaller states or specific regions. This way, the system ensures that the winning candidate is representative of the entire country, not just a few states.

Furthermore, the current system ensures that the President-elect has won a clear mandate to govern. If the President-elect had only won the popular vote by a small percentage, as has happened in the past, they would not be able to govern effectively, as they would not have a clear mandate from the voters.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves many important purposes that cannot be overlooked. It promotes fairness, prevents the tyranny of the majority, and ensures that the President-elect has won a mandate to govern effectively. I urge you, therefore, to support maintaining this system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
