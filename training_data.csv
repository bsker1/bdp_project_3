"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto explains how a recent technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" reveals human emotions in pictures. This is actually rather convincing to believe. How can you identify a picture's emotions through a new software? The use of the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" used to read facial emotional expressions is not valuable to students in classroom because it seems too expensive for a public school to use, it looks to be more useful at images, and video games.

""Facial Action Coding System"" is not useful to students in a classroom because it is expensive and mostly unaffordable for all classes. D'Alto explains what this technology is made up of, and its component looks expensive. On paragraph 3 the author explains that, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" (D'Alto 3) Having a 3-D model computer in classes not less than a hundred is money consuming and might ruin the school's budget. Having such prestige technology in class does not mean the students in the classroom will learn better or try changing their facial expressions.

Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.

Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery."" (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.

Lastly, the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.",0
"I like this feature. I'd consider it very helpful on both computers and robots. Regarding robots, I wonder if Baymax from Disney's ""Big Hero 6"" had something like it. He was like a robotic nurse as explained by the main character. However, it wouldn't work in concrete tunnels.

Regarding computers, if the feature could have come out a bit sooner, then Nickelodeon could've used it for a non-animated TV show they came out with, called ""I Am Frankie"". I'm still waiting for the show to continue. In one of the last two episodes of this show, one of the judges for this competition that was like a quiz show said that computers can't feel human emotions, but a girl who was part computer proved her wrong. I like this show because it gives me proof of how smart computers are.

In conclusion, this feature should be used in all computers. I'd like for it to be used in robots too, that way robots could take the expression and mimic it. I'm pretty sure the ""Transformers"" movies have something like it too. If the ""Transformers"" movies and ""Big Hero 6"" use it then it was probably already thought of. With computers, someone could type into the computer ""How am I feeling today?"" and the computer could respond with an emotion like said computer has ESP.",0
"Limiting the usage of car's would have many good outcomes. There would be less polution in our air, it would lower the usage of our fossil fuels and People would live heathier lives without all the smog in the air to cause illnesses.

If all areas of the united states banned or limited the vehile uses here it could greatly reduce the polution in our air. Which would in a long term result cause for better health conditions in people, but we'd sooner realize better health in young childern and the elderly. We would all have cleaner safer air to breath. But it would also help with the enviroment, the number of plants an animals harmed by polution would begin to decrease until the was just a fraction of the amount there is in this time now.

Also limiting the usage of cars will lower our use an burning of precious fossil fuels that once we use them up they are gone. Which this would also save us mass amounts of money that we we could use to keep this country out of debt. Limiting the use of cars will also stop us from having to get our fosssil fuel (oil) from other countries an having debts and money issues with all these other contries. We need to realixe that the usage of fossil fuels all these cars we have is draining our planet which is our home, what are we going to do when its a waste land after we suck all its nature fossil fuels an resources out of it.

Lastly the limiting of cars in the united astates would eventually cause for better health conditions in everyone but we'd sooner realize it in young childern an elderly adults. They wouldn't have such hard times breathing that they do have now causes by all of the polution in our air now. It would take some time but eventaully we'd have cleaner fresher air to breath and this would help decrease the amount of smog an decrease the amount of people with respatory health issues.

These are all things we need to be thinking about when we go into a discussion of limiting car usage these are not the only reasons there are many many more that can be used to help push the movement of limited car use.",0
"Scientists have studied and implored the idea of understanding the solar system, specifically the Milky Way.

In investigating the solar system, Venus shows promises of exploration.

Though Venus itself is denser and hotter than Earth, both planets are one in the same.

The author of the passage utilizes this in explaining as to why investing into the research of this particular planet in the Milky Way is worth it.

The author does this by comparing Venus to Earth within Venus's geometric structures as well as its weather patterns.

Venus can be said to be Earth's twin.

Known as the second planet from the sun, Venus was once like how our planet is today based on scientists' knowledge.

According to the passage the planet,""...(W)as probably covered largely with oceans..."".

Earth contains 70% of water and has life on it and with this quote describing that Venus had water at one point in time, it too might have supported life forms which is what the author is attempting to explain in his writings.

Like Earth, Venus obtains the same landformations.

Another detail provided from the article states,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" indicating not only that this planet once held water but, also sustains land structures identicle to Earth's.

In the final section of paragraph 3 it enscribes,""...(G)eology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerfull earthquakes, and...lighting strikes..."".

Along with the planets identicle features to Earth's, It also features weather patterns and conditions that are compatible too.

Combining all of this information, Venus can be idealized as Earth.

The author gets to the point by comparing the various landforms, weather, and natural disasters of the two space rocks.

Researching Venus could not only mean furthering the understanding of this particular planet but, also Earth too.

Lastly, continuing the study on Venus is so vital that by doing so, man could possibly land another planet.",0
"The electoral college needs to be kept, it is the easiest way to vote for a presidential canidate. People may not like it because the people who are voting for a president really are not voting for the  president, their voting for the electors to vote for the president. Which makes sense, but the electoral college is simple and yet very reliable in many ways people dont see.

The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. I  can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. The presidential canidates look for states that have the most electoral votes, but they also need more votes than the other canidate so every vote counts.

Citizens may think that the canidates dont care about their state, but they do in more ways than you think. The electoral college has a requirement, trans-regional appeal, which means that a canidate is popular in a certain region of the U.S for example, Mitt Romney he was the most popular in the south in 2012's election. Romney did not canpain heavily in the south so he did not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in the states he knows he would win in.

The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept. The Electoral college may seem a bit unfair but its also the most easiest desion making tool when it comes to electing. Its been around for years it would make no sense to get rid of it.",0
"I would know if it was real or not if only i had seen it with my own eyes but, im against the fact that they're saying that it's a real face made by the aliens because nobody would really think that there are aliens living in space. I also would know that it's not a face of the pharoah because the text says that it's a ""huge rock formation"". Nobody would really think that aliens created a face that big, even if there were aliens living in space i would not think that those type of creatures have any clue of how to build big structure like that. Only if i were out there in space looking at the face then i would know my self that it's real or not. A humans eye could tell if anything is real or not. If the world had something to prove that it's not a face then i would be with them and i would agree to everything they say about it, cause the person who thought that it was a face built by the aliens then i bet the majority of the peoples would disagree. All im trying to say is that i dont't believe that the aliens would build a face like structure.",0
"using this technology to read the emotions of students in a class room is valuable because you can tell a lot if a student is confused or even to angry or to sad to learn. plus you can tell if the teacher is doing her job right or if the student feels confortable in the class room you can also learn if the student feels bullied or not safe in the class room. We could also tell if the student is acutally happy in the class because of the facial action coding system that even allows you to figure out if the student has a genuine or false smile stated in paragraph 8 of the text. This technology could help students to learn better, students that come from other country's and dont know how to speak for thereself or are just to shy to speak out. At last is the communication that the teacher and student can have through this device would be better since the device can read emotions the teacher can learn from all of her students on how they like to learn and how they dont like to learn.",0
"The Sea Cowboys, If you like helping people and love animals this is the job for you. This program helps people in need and animals in need. Joining the Sea Cowboys can help make a diffrent in peoples lives.

This job a hard job, They need people that are tough and can handle a lot of things. Sometimes the seas were rough and it is hard not to get sea sick. There is a time to have fun on board and there is a time to be reponsible and work hard.

Being a sea cowboy is a very good oppertundity, You can travle around the world and can explore new things. After you become a sea cowboy you will have lot of responceabilty and will be more aware of your surondings and be grateful for what you have because some people dont have those things.

If you worked as a farmer or worked with animals you should join the sea cowboys. You can make a diffrence.",0
"You and I both know very well that we love to breath fresh air. Going out into the forest and taking a big breath of what is called ""fresh air."" Why cant we get that in an everyday life? I'll tell you why, because of polution. Cars are a ginormous part of polution, so what if we drove less?

In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars almost completely. The streets in Vauban are ""car free."" If you want a car, you have to park it at a local park garage for 40,000 dollars added onto your house. That isnt even worth paying for. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She lives in this town so she knows how it is. Giving up a car can reduce stress! Boy do some people need to give up cars.

America's obeisity count is getting higher and higher by the month. What if we gave up cars? people would have to walk everywhere! That's a good way to get exercise. In passage 1 it says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Stores are helping people out so they can walk to get what they need instead of driving.

It will be so much less expensive in everyday life if you dont have a car. You won't have to pay for gas, you won't have to pay for car insurance and you won't have to pay for mantanence! You also will not have to pay something crazy like ""$40,000, along with a home."" If I had to pay that much more money to keep up with a car, I would give it up in an instant. I barely have enough money to support the car alone, there is no way i can pay an extra 40,000 dollars!

Not having a car seems easier and healthier to me! You can walk more, so you get you exercise in everyday. You dont have to spend money on the car, no gas, no insurance and no mantanance! That means you can spend it on important stuff, perhaps on schooling! You also dont have as much stress on your hands. You dont have to worry about stopped traffic because you can just walk, ride a bike, or jog to where ever you have a desire to go. I say we get rid of cars all together in the United States of America.",0
"You should join the Seagoing cowboys program overseas. I'f you join you will get to go to many places to help the states, or countries. You will take care animals day and night. To take care of the animals you will have to keep there stalls clean, and get their hay from the lower holds on the ship. Some places take about two weeks or even up to a few months to arrive. Once you loaded all the animals up and took care of them and the animals home is clean and provides food in the wild and in the safe areas, then you will unload the animals off the boat and take them back to where they belong. After all the animal are gone you get to have fun since there is no animals to take care of. Now that all the animals are gone you get to have fun and play games like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds that animals were in and been housed. There will also be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. So for the rest of the few weeks or so after everything is done you get to play games and have fun until it's time to get off board.",0
"I belive that if they make a driverless car thier would be a huge impact in the whole world because of the fact that you would not have to drive the car it's driveing its self. The google car can drive to a certain standard and how fast it would go driveing by its self. The maping in the car can be very profiencent. The google car can drive to a certain standard. The most that the car has gone is 25 mph driveing by its self. Google started this project since 2009 so time by time thier investing into this car to make it more proficent every time they invest to the car. They make the computer more better so thier would be less accidents while being in the google car. They had made more improvements in the cars sensor so the car can be more safer. The google car has antilock brakes. The google car is more proficent then a taxi dirver and the gas last more. In 2013 BMW had annouced the had made a "" traffic jam assistant"". Nisan and Audi had plans to have a driverless car by 2020 not very long. But we are getting closer and closer every day seeing the future in our own eyes. The dirverless car will help people who do not have that much money to be in a get a safe ride.

In somes states its llegal to have a driverless car. The cars have been proved to be more safe then any regular car.",0
"The Face on Mars is not an alien monument or creation. A lot of people do think that it was made by some alien life form but they are mistaken. Scientists have done multiple studies to conclude that it is a natural landformation.

First of all, the formation is known as a mesa. There are shadows from the formation that give the illusion of eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Also in the picture from 2001 each pixel in the photo graph is 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see any artifacts or structures if there were any.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation. Scientists have proven this by the effect of the shadows on the rock, the fact that it is a mesa, and by there not being any artifacts on or around the formation. Therefore, this is not evidence of there being ancient civilizations on Mars.",0
"Venus is the second planet from the sun, and one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. By some this planet is called the ""Evening Star'' because of how bright it is. This planet is known as Earth's twin, because its the closest planet to Earth in size and density. Often times the closest planet to Earth if it wasnt for the way Mars orbited. There is alot about Venus that people don't know about. Through the good in this planet it's also dangerous.

Venus has the hottest suface tempature of any planet on the solar syatem, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Knowing what the atmosphere is like up there makes it harder for people in Nasa. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, as it states in paragraph 2. Every since then no aircraft has touched Venus in almost 3 decades. This planets surface average tempature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 90 times greater than Earths surface. Venus's atmosphere is not just hot it also contains up to 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for your lungs.

Despite the dangers scientist are looking for new ways to explor this planet. Nasa has been trying to look for new ways but also some old ways from World War 2 that they could improve on. As they were looking for different ways they came up with the idea to hover over the plant so they could see it scloser, and that would allow humans to survive up to 170 degree weather. Through our the dangers and the beauty of this planet, scientist wont stop until they explorer this star.",0
"Limiting car usage can affect our environment in so many ways. Although you may have not ever thought about it before, limiting car usage can help not only our environment, but ourselves as well. Let's talk about what can happen if we ditch our vehicles.

People in Germany have completely given up their cars for the most part already. Since most of their residents are suburban pioneers, they find almost no point of even owning a car. Here in America we use cars for transportation for almost everything! In Germany, many have admitted that owning a car makes them stressd. Heidrun Walter who is a media trainer said, ""I'm much happier this way."" The trend of not owning a car isn't just growing in Europe. Lot's of families from Chicago are abandoning their cars as well.

The city of Paris has banned driving for a good environmental reason. There has been so much pollution in the city from smog that there was a driving ban to clear the city's air. If anyone is caught driving, they are sent a fine of 22euro, which is 31 here in the US. Although this may seem like a harsh punishment, it has helped Paris overcome a lot of its smog. The only exceptions when it comes to driving are delivery companies and public transit.

Bogota, Columbia has jumped on the bandwagon along with many other places. This country put a ban on cars to prevent smog as well. There was a huge turnout on their part for doing this. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Ever since the day where they banned cars for a short period of time, there has been many other new advancements in their society. Parks and sports centers have spread throughout the city, uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic, and new restaurantsupscale shopping districts have opened up.

Last, limiting car usage also has a great effect when it comes to getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions. Research has suggested that Americans are now buying fewer cars, fewer licenses, and overall driving less. It seems as many people are starting to open up their eyes and realize all of the long term effects that come with car overusage. Article 4 clearly states that many sociologist believe that if this pattern persist, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. It is said that creating cities in which pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to not only save time and conserve resources, but also lower emissions and improve our safety.

All in all, there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. We can help dramatically improve our environment and safety. More people should take into consideration about being more conservative when it comes to transportation. We can work around a lot of it by simply walking or riding our bikes short distances rather than wasting a lot of energy with cars.",0
"I think the way by making a happy face is a expermiment in also make me fell slighty happy, emotion or moving i s when your facial muscles ans not only experiment also make me, or you slighty and happy in also by theory of emotion, and moving not only expresses emotions, but also may even help prouce people.

introduction.

I think the expresion in one of the mirror it sugest an emotion we can lab our parther to reconize whick one is a introduction of a face that looks happy, and it also about the body, and kind of like actions units these even indicate the different between a genuies smile and a forced one. body paragraph, bu I think in a false smile, maybe the mouth is stretched in another way or to a sideway like using zygomatic major and a different muscle, to an expert face dosn't lie.

i think mona lisa demostration is really intented to bring a smile to another person is smile, while it shows just much a computer can do imagine a computer that knows when you are sad, for example if you smile when a web ad appers on your screen, a similar and might follow,

I think the same technology can make computer animated facer or more expressive for example like video games or video surgery, and most human communication is nonvebal, includind like emotional communication.

Maybe the phone can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lsa's smile.",0
"Many people thought that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I do not agree with that statement because there is no evidence supporting that theory. However, there is evidence supporting that the face is merely a landform that was created naturally. Throughout the article, it shares ideas from NASA, which is the foundation that discovered the face on Mars in the first place.

The first statement that the article makes about the face being a natural landform is, ""New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" This one statement shows that NASA, one of the biggest names in space industry, believes the face is only a mesa. The people back in the Jet Propulsion Lab must have been surprised to see such a startling sight, but luckily NASA provides more information to show that the face is only a simple landform.

The text provides a caption from the message unveiled by NASA. The caption states, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This exact caption says the exact proof that the face is clearly just a rock formation. Every person should already know how shadows can, well, cast shadows that may give illusions of other objects.

Some people that believe in aliens may say that it would be crazy to think that a rock formation and shadows could form the illusion of a face, but I've seen shadows that are casted when the sun hits them just right. Isn't it completely logical that the sun could hit the shadows to fill the holes in the rocks? I sure believe so.

The last quote I would like to give as my evidence is, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you couold see what they were!"" This single statement shows that the cameras they were using to the maximum resolution, would in fact show if there was actually an alien artifact on the planet. But the strongest possible photo showed no ancient alien artifacts. It only showed a natural rock formation with shadows that formed what appeared to be a face.",0
"Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, there are many reasons. Firstly, you have many chances of adventure. Who knows what could happen, but it could be worth the risk. Another reason you should consider being apart of the great program is the exprience. This could be a once in a lifetime offer that may never apear again. Furthermore, the learning oppurtunities are endless, and maybe even fun.

The places you could go. It almost seems like a dream when thinking about the many chances and oppurtunities that may stand with an open door. You could meet some great, new people. See some great new places. Luke stated from the passage ,""Besides helping people, I has the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" You have the life-changing chance to not only help the needy, but to see things some don't have the chance to. Not only see, but exprience.

Expriencing new things can be terryifying, but can be something incredible as well. You can visit museums, ride bikes through the city, dine at the fanciest restaraunts with some new-found friends. Not only can you do all of those things, you can become close with the animals and other workers while on the journey. You may be busy throughout, but think of the job you are doing for so many in need, It's all worth the work. Expriencing is also learning.

Learning new things is like having money in your pocket. You may need all that you learn one day, and you need to be prepared for whatever life throws at you. One of the many things for you to learn while being a Seagoing Cowboy is how to care for animals. Animals have needs like humans. They need food, water and sometimes shelter to survive life's harsh ways. Another thing you may need to learn is how to communicate in other languages, or maybe how to speak in that language. You may also need to learn how to cook different foods, or how to live in harsher conditions like some do in other countries. The possibilities are endless whe it comes to learning new things, sometimes they are as simple as doing the dishes. But we can agree that there is more fun things to do rather than doing the dishes.

Stated in paragraph 8, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, esprecially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and vollyeball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and games also helped pass the time."" Finding ways to entertain yourself doesn't seem to be hard when you have many crew members who would eargerly accecpt the oppurtunity to play a good game of catch.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy seems to be a great oppurtunity for many to exprience. The many fun activites, the great cultures, the amazing people, and new things to learn should be enough to convince someone to become a Seagoing Cowboy and do some outstanding things for those in need.",0
"As the world changes and humans present more and more issues involving the enviroment many things must change in order to survive. cars are a huge problem to not only the enviroment but to us people also. it has been proven by scientist that cars provide more stress to humans lives, cars are also responsible for a majority of the green house gasses emmited on earth, and

Cars in the modern day are playing a huge role in many people everday lives, most even depend on the car to move on with the ir days. What most don't know is that the use cars provide more issuse within their daily lives than not using them. for example a mother of two from vauban, germany states that "" when she used a car everyday she used to be very tense, and now that she has given away her car theat she is much happier"". scientist have proven that "" having to keep a car up and running, and dealing with all of the maintence that comes with it is casing many families to begin pinching pennies"". Cars consume most of the money that people earn there for many people are becoming poor because they must take care of their automobile.

"" Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe ...and up to 50% in most car-intensive areas in the united states"" say scientist. After a day of a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog in paris; congestion on the streets was down 60%, and the smog nearly covering France also lessened. The main cause of the build up of smog over France is because of the cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air in the atmosphere to trap car emissions. The use of diesel fuel in France also contributed to the intensifiying smog; considering that diesel fuel is used in 67% of vehicles in France.

The emission of Greenhouse gases from cars is destroying our enviroment and atmosphere which could potentially end up harming people in the long hall. So the decrese of car usage and the increse of riding bikes and walking to reach our destinations such as the people of Vauban, Germany could not only help the enviroment but make life slightly easier and less stressful.",0
"Driverless cars have the potential to be somthing great. These cars could make the road a safer place and save you money. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author makes points both for and againts driverless cars. Personally, I am for driverless cars.

Driverless cars could greatly reduce the amount of money spent on cars. Much like the cofounder of Google, Sergey Brin, I like the idea of being able to call for a driverless car. Sergey Brin foresees that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Households could save the money they saved from not buying a car to go on a much needed family vacation.

Driverless cars could be much safer than a car driven by a human. These cars would have many sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius has a rotating sensor on the roof. While the human brain is amazing, it cannot process what is happening at all angles around the car. A hightened awareness of the car's surroundings could result in less wrecks. However, a human driver would still have to be in the front seat in case of an emergency.

Driverless cars could be intrumental in both long road trips and nights out. It can be very hard to stay awake when driving after a long day of work. The driverless car could drive while you doze off and has the ability to alert you when human supervision is needed. The same goes for long road trips. It is illegal and incredibly dangerous to drink and drive. With the driverless car, drinking and driving wrecks could be a thing of the past. After a night out you could crawl into your driverless car and be safe while it drives you home, given there is not a need for a human during the drive.

All in all, driverless cars could improve many aspects of life. The cars could save you money and allow you to rest after a long day. While there are still some risks associated with the driverless car, I believe the pros outweigh the cons.",0
"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have great benifits in the classroom. The benifits of this new system will include increased student attentiveness and more participation. children's education is very valuabe in society, and any technology advances that can increase the knowledge of children is essential.

When ones self is intrested in something or someone ,one tends to pay attention to the thing one is intrested in. Kids today are more likley to pay attention and participate in something in school if they like the subject or have some sort of intrest in the topic. Not many children do exceptionally well in classes they dislike. This system will increase students attention in the classroom. If a child likes the subject they will do better. According to Dr. Huang of the University of Illinois he predicts that"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This is very valuable in teaching many kids who are confused are to afraid to ask questions and get help. Now withhout asking all the students and wasting more class time, teachers can get easy feedback. Lastly when students are intrested in a topic theyre likley to ask questions about the topic, this is increased participation.

In Conclusion students the benifits of the Facial Action Coding System will have benifis in the classroom such as student attentiveness and more participation. Children are the future of tommorow, the best advances of education are essential to their well being. Students will learn more by being more and engaged and intrested. technology has become a huge part of our educaton syste,.",0
"You may think it was created by aliens, but can you really support that?

From what scientists have researched, they found many evidence to support their conclusion.

Some people do think it is the work of aliens, but many people have more resonable explanations.

That they can support from evidence they have either seen, watched, or heard about, that make it a valid explanation.

First off, scientists thought it could possible be just another Martian mesa, because they were common around Cydonia.

Most of all they wouldn't send pictures and information out to the public without being possitive about their discoveries.

Escpecialy if they knew how big of a pop icon it would turn out to be.

It has starred in Hollywood fils, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a huanted grocery store checkout line for 25 years.

I do however understand your resoning for thinking it was created by alliens because...

Even though Martian mesa's were common in Cydonia, this one had a unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Many people also thought the allien marking were hidden, because of haze.

Sense it was a cloudy time of the year for the Red Planet.

In the end the scientist concluded that it really was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

Butte and Mesas are also very common around the American West.

Garvin says ""It reminds me most of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,""",0
"On May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars while taking photos of possible landing sites. As it was taking photos, it noticed a dome that resembled a human face. The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.

In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have came to the conclusion that there is life on mars only becuase they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.

In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.

In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.",0
"Limiting car usage can be very benifical in many ways such as , enviromental , finantialy , economicly.

Car usage plays a big roll in todays society. People use there vehicles everyday to get around . But if we change that the whole world could beneifit from it . The author says "" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of america's emissions , just behind power plants"". Which means by cutting all these greenhouse gases down we could be saving the planet and creating a better world for the generations to come .

Rush hour would never be a problem again if cars where not an opotion anymore. The evidence says that "" President obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, enveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior : recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by "". This can result in good out comes for people all across the world.

In conclusion , by everybody stepping up and making a change in the way we use transportation the world could turn out to be a better place to live in health and economic whise . By limiting car usage our country and transportation can evolve as we know it .",0
"Have you ever thought about what life would be like on Venus? Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", is said to be a challenge when it comes to exploring. The author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped.

First of all, Venus, also known to be Earths ""twin"", is a mystery. The author tells the readers about what past explorations have been like and why no one is living or has traveled to Venus in almost three decades. """"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."". The author also tells of why no space craft has been able to survive the landing on Venus. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."". However that does not stop scientist from trying to create more explorations to gain more research.

In addition to the surface being inhospitable, that does not stop scientist from planning more explorations to gain more research. The author asks us, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface?"". Well we are told that, ""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous tgo thoses on Earth."". Which tells us that even scientist are still figuring out how Earth became Earth, and if Venus was just like Earth. Which leads to more research and more information.

Finally, we are told about how a-like Earth and Venus are through the research of the scientists. Which scientist believe we should not stop our travels just because of dangers. In paragraph 8 the author states, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". This shows that the author does not believe that the danger should hold us back and stop us from exploring. In the same paragraph it also states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Over all, the author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped. By showing the readers that there is more than what meets the eye when talking about Venus. Also that one should never let danger stop them from exploring.",0
"Dear State Senator,

I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I'm concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment we-us Americans-use the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that ""the founding fathers established it in the Constitution."" But ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors."" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors."" Did you realize that ""a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President""? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves.

I understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" They could use a helping hand as well! ""The presidential election is held every four years."" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don't we give the people what they want? ""Most states have a 'winner-takes-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation.'"" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, is it not Senator?

""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" Rather than worrying about ""certainty of outcome"", ""everyone's president"", ""swing states"", ""big states"", and ""avoiding run-off elections"", why not just let our beloved, fortunate, intelligent American citizens be happy and choose who they would prefer run their life?",0
"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consist of the selection of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors wher they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Personally I believe that Electoral Colleges work because it would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman, and it would also look good on your reputation.

It would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman. Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry.

It would look good on your reputation. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. I know your would wat that because that would be great, and really helpful. The presidential election is held every four yoears on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential  election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official recors of the presidential election.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what researchers call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.",0
"The Face on Mar's is just a natural landform because, there is no living organism on Mar's . scientist figurged it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shawdo9ws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. So as you read you might think there is something living on Mar's but the Face on Mar's is acually is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms it is common around the American West. A lava dome is the form of the Face on Mar's, "" the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mar's. To Conclusion, A lava dome is the creation of the Face because Mar's is not a place where you are abl;e to live because if you are not able to plant how would you have food to live and temp. get as high as 100 degrees in the morning and as low as 0 degrees at night also there are very bay storms so i do not know if anyone would be able to live on Mar's.",0
"Do you believe in aliens? If so do you believe they left acients remains behind? If you do you're not the only one . About 25 years ago NASA's Viking 1 space craft was circling the planet of Mars , snapping pictures of possible landing zones for it's sister ship viking 2, when it spotted the likeness of a human face . The head was aproximatly two miles long and was staring back at the cameres from a region from Mars called Cydonia .

Mission control were suprised at first until they realised it was just another ""Martian mesa"". A few days later NASA unveiled the image to the public and the caption noted huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it was a great way to attract attention to Mars . The ""Face on Mars "" has became a pop icon it has starred in many magazines and books.

All the fame that came from the marking soon died out this was all just a natural land formation , it had nothing to do with aliens . Have you ever heard of the

Snake River Plain of Idaho , well it has the same natural formations such as Mars. Many people including you believe that aliens created it ,but there is no proof , in contrast aliens have never even been discovered so why conclude they made this natural formation.

However there is a reason why some people may believ that this is an alien making. The cameras that were used that day had trouble getting a clear image because of the cloudy weather that day. So the image is very blurred which may lead to some differnt reasoning on the ""Face on Mars"". NASA try their best to get better shots to prove if it was an alien artifact or not , We felt this was important to taxpayers, said Jim Garvin .

Although , this image would bring NASA biliions of dollars if it had been discovered near an ancient civilization .It was only a natural earth formation caused by natural causes , if there was an earthquake would you think aliens made that to . No , exactly because aliens do not exist as we know it. We have no proof that they exist to why conclude that they had made markings on Mars . Just to prove to conspirists like you that aliens didn't leave a marking NASA went to the same spot they took the first images and and retook them again in better weather conditions. They once again found nothing that would relate to a ""martain marking"".

In conclusion , the ""Face On Mars"" was just a natural formation. This happens in many places on earth too . Which is why you should believe that aliens didnt leave a mark on mars . What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",0
"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy enough even though it is very dangerous. The author mentioned that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet . His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray. A ""blimp-like"" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans. So this would help make the mission capeable of completing.

He also mentions how peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penertrate the dense atmosphere making it hard to take photographs . They also cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. So many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to help gain some imformation of Venus.

They are working on other ways to study Venus such as simplified electrnics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface . So far they have lasted for 3 weeks in these conditions which is more than enough time hopefully for them to be able to grab enough information. Their other project that they are working on is using an old technology called mechanical computers. They are powerful, flexible, and quick. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

He feels that studying Venus even though its dangerous is valuable because of the insight they could gain about the planet itself but also becuase ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

I think the author supported his claim very well he explained why he thought it as nessary to go even though it is dangerous and he gave solutions to some of the dangers on Venus such as sollution to the heat and ways to actually help gain evicence and imformation on Venus.",0

YES THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS JUST INCASE THE VOTERS DONT NEED TO COMPARE THE ELECTIONS AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD MAKE THERE FINAL DECISION AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION WHO TO VOTE FOR AND IT COMES UP BETWEEN THE STATES.YES THEY SHOULD DO A FINAL VOTE DECISION AT THE END OF IT.",0
"From the very start the author explains the pure beuty of venus, it's nicknamed the ""evening star"" because its one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Another name for this planet would be Earths ""twin"" giving the planet a more welcoming and safer tone. The planet is nearly identical in density and size and in distance, Because of its close range you would think studying such a planet would be easy. the only problem is that earth, venus, and mars orbit the sun at difrent speeds making venus sometimes farther from the earth than mars. Venus is, in space terms, ""right around the corner"" so humans have sent numerous spacecraft, all unmanned, to go and inspect the planet to see if it's safe for human contact. The only problem has been that all the spacecrafts sent have only lasted a couple of hours so to our knowledge it is un-inhabitable. This could explain why we havent had a single spacecraft explore the area in over three decades.

The info we have gathered also contributes to the dangerous nature of venus's reputation as a planet, the atmosphere is described as thick with a blanket of 97% carbon dioxide. A even more challenging factor is the fact that the clouds of venus are highly carosive. Temperatures are over 800 degrees farenheit, the surface temperature of venus is the hottest out of all the plaenets in our solar system.

There's other factor that make venus sound nearly inhospitable but if thats the case why do we still strive to learn more about this vishious planet? Well its because this planet was most likely one of the closest planets related to earth, and still is, it says ""long ago, Venus was probobly covered largely with oceans and could have suported various forms of life, just like earth."" It is our sister planet and theres many fweatures of the planet that are undisputably analougous to those on earth. SInce the planet is so close it is a crucial factor in play giving how long it takes for spacecraft to reach its destination, saving us time and more reaserch.

Now the only question is making reserch safe and scientifically productive, which National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has already been discusing and they have a compeling idea. What theyre discusing is a spacecraft that can hover over the planets fray ,30 miles or so, out of harms way, safe for scientists to examine from afar and quicker to send spacecrafts to the surface. Solar power would run the spacecraft and radiation from that distance would not exceed that of earths. Conditions wont be easy but they would be managable enough for humans to survive. Here on earth even theyres plenty of studies in the works on seing what technology would work best for surviving on venus. This includes a simple electronic made of silicone tested in a chamber simulating that of venus's harsh surface condition, this simple electronic has lasted three weks under these harsh conditions. With thechnology advancing and humans more and more eager to discover our sister planet, if we keep at it we should one day be able to survive on earths twin.",0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!",0
"The thought of driverless cars is amazing. Are there more dangers than what we think? If the car is supposed to alert the drive what happens if it fails to do so in enough time to stop the crash? If it is driverless your kids could start the car and leave they wouldnt need to even touch the wheel. Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet.

Just think it drives itself, your daughter wants to go somewhere and you wont take her. She could turn the car on and set a destination anywhere and the car would take her there. You lost your car to an eight year old who couldnt reach the pedals. Now if the car had to be driven by a person she wouldnt have been able to leave. Also if your sick and dizzy and you need to go to the hospital your car could take you there. If someone is injured and you have to help them while the car is moving thats another advantage.

Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.

A teenager who DOES NOT know how to drive is supposed to steal a car for a gang as an initiation. He knows what the new driverless car looks like. Its the new car you just bout for 30 Thousand dollors. He brakes into the car and turns it on and sets the destination for the gangs warehouse. It drives itself there. He wouldnt have gotten the car there if it didnt drive itself.

What if the car doesnt stop at the lights and it causes an accident? Three people are injured two end up dieing. It could have been prevented if the driver of the driverless car was paying attention to the road. With the driverless car how many people do you really think will still pay attention to the road. This is a waste of taxe and government money. If we are going to use our money on something it should be to make gas cheaper, help veterans who are homeless, the wounded warriors who give us the freedom to spend money.

Driverless cars yes will change the world but i doubt it is for the better. Kids wont need to have drivers lisence if the car drives itself. How would we know that the vehicle is going to help us and not cause more wrecks.",0
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is an amazing opportunity. You get to help people in need, and you get the added bonus of having fun and sightseeing on the trip. If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all.

Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..."" This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightsee whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" would be ""Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime.""

That is why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program. It is completely worth it and you will come back from this amazing experience more aware of what needs to be done to help people in other countries. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity that you will treasure for the rest of your life.",0
"It is equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. Garvin says that its just the shading of the area that makes it look like a face. Over the years the face changes it starts to change shape or crust over and because of that it makes it look like a natural landform. NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars. They most likely sent out on the web to stir up peoples thoughts and to make them nervous about if there really is life on mars.

In 1976 you can sort of tell that there is a face on the rock formation. In 1998 you can really tell that there is a face there, but you can also see a change in lighting which because of that you can see the face more. In 2001 there is no lighting like the first one but its at a different angle so with the lighting on the second one it blocks out the cracks so its ageing over time and that proves that its a rock formation.",0
"Human emotion. Once thought to be something held exclusive to humans, can now be interpreted by computers. Allowing anything with a camera to read the muscles in ones face to tell the emotion they currently portray. There are many different outlooks on the future use of this technology, but one in particular focuses on using it in the classroom.

The technololgy used to read our emotions is known as the Facial Action Coding System or FACS. It models a human face and all 44 of its muscles, and looks for certain cues to tell them emotion being conveyed by the subject. FACS can tell when one is happy, sad, angry, cionfused, surprised, disgusted, and afraid. FACS can even tell the difference between ""fake"" emotions and real ones. This means that it can tell if a facial expression is being forced, based on what muscles are being used.

On the subject of use in the classroom, it could be very benificial to students and teachers alike. It can read when a student gets confused on a topic, and can then adjust the lesson to fit their needs. It can tell when a student is feeling drowsy and upset, or when a student is attentive and alert. This way teachers can recognize when a student needs assistance. This technology, in all, can be very useful if applied to them classroom, and even the rest of the world, properly, making it a very impressive step into the future for mankind.

Just think. A computer able to read the human face to determi9ne what emotion they feel. Skepticism is understandable, what with the advancement of AI and related movies such as The Terminator, where AI has tooken over the human race, but a future like that is to be left in the world of fiction. This technology is the next step into the age of human technology integration, like we've already seen with the introduction of smart devices. Mankind will only continue to move forward and innovate, even beyond percieved limits.",0
"The effect of cars in our world today has grown tremendously. As companies create new models of various cars, buyers don't often think twice about how these cars hurt the environment and cause serious global emissions. The production of ""Hybrids"" is the first step to solving this problem. The advantages of limiting car usage can result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.

Pollution amounts have skyrocketed in the past several years. Due to the increase in the amount of people on the road using motor vehicles, pollution has increased and is becoming more of a threat than ever before. In Vauban, Germany, a new community has been constructed, and contains suburban pioneers that have given up their cars. They are devoted to taking public transit, such as city buses, or even personal vehicles like a bicycle. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) The residents of this community are committed to preserving Earth by limiting their car usage to reduce pollution. Pollution is a harmful matter that can cause negative effects to an area. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Car-Free Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.) When you limit the amount of time you use your car, not only does it reduce pollution, but it also saves you money, now that you are not paying a monthly fee, or taxes on the car, or for gas every month.

In the exquisite community in Vauban, Germany, many of those people have gotten rid of their car, and are now probably saving extremely high amounts of money. Between highway tolls, gas, oil changes, insurance, and the overall monthly payment on a car, these residents are saving so much money because they are not paying for all of these necessities. When they travel, they use public transit, like the city bus, which costs a fraction of what car owners pay. Paris is trying to limit the amount of individual transportation due to the smog in the area, so they made a deal. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) People taking public transit are saving even more money now. Due to the intense smog in Paris, and the busy streets, a limit was set for the amount of drivers allowed on the road throughout the week. ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters...Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Compared to the amount of money car owners spend, people without a car save a lot more money.

With the reduction of car usage, a safer community will result as well. The amounts of accidents will be substantially lower. With fewer cars on the road, the risks of car crashes greatly decrease. Many accidents result in impatience at the wheel, and careless drivers. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog.) Bogota, Columbia created a day for no car usage and it turned out to be a very big success, spreading across borders and leaving an impression on other countries about how limited car usage positively effects the environment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.) Countries across the globe are attempting to limit car usage, and it will begin to greatly help the environments. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture.)

The effect of cars today is not a positive thing, except for hybrid cars. Countries are beginning to limit car usage and soon we will see the impact and changes in the enviromments due to car reduction. Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.",0
"Cars have become an extravigant part of our daily lives, to helping us with transportation or just taking us out for a ride out in the city. They have made their ways into our world.. But are they truly helping us and our enviornment.?

Out in Vauban, Germany- Residents of an upscale community, and other grand cities all around the world have given up one of mankinds best teleportation invention: You guessed it... their auto-mobiles.

In one of the excerpts from

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.""

the city of Vauban's streets they have officially gone ""car-free"" - except for some of the main thoroughfare, in which the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not whatsoever own any cars at all, and 57 percent of the residents here have sold their car just to move here. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" she quotes. Middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. That, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are now responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 52 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. ""All of our development since World war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" said an official of Transportation America, David Goldberg. In tghe United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promorting ""car reduced"" communitites, and legislators are starting to act cautiously.

Other cities are also starting to take after Vauban. After many days of near- record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving banm to clear the air of the global city and are trying to have a smog free city.

In the excerpt

""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.""

by Andrew Selsky. Bogota, Colombia has taken noticed also an has a program that's set to spread to other countries as well as theirs. It was the third staright year in which they have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day without cars in their capital city of 7 million people. Their goal for doing this event for a day is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog as well. As for the United States of America some people have take a toll for this ambitious goal in other countries that has left many researchers ponderwing a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving? Researchers say in American Behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewwer licenses as each year goes by. But as of April 2013 the economy has been able to risen and now many people can start buying new cars. Part of the reason why driving sessions were decreasing was because residents could not afford cars, and unem[ployment were't going to work. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downtuern and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. Only the next few years will be telling how our enviornmental world will be.

As for this, depriving cars out of the road can lead to a free smog envionrment where more people can be healthier and think smart about their world, and it might just actually help keep the planet clean and other ideas like getting rid of cars for good. Only we can lead how our future generations will view this world, so why not benefit earth instead of destroying it...?",0
"To the author, the limitations that exploring venus brings, should not be enough to kill the curiosity that many of us have. Although it has been a long time since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus, the author believes that with the technology and willpower we have today, Venus could be explored.

The author keeps referring to Venus as earth's twin. this could show that the author is trying to get across that this planet is not much different from ours. This technique can help pursuade people into believing that it is beyond possible to touch down on Venus. The author writes about alot of the reasons why we could go to Venus, but makes sure to touch on the challenges people may face and the limitations. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" These limitations stated in paragraph 3 of the article are just some of the challenges associated with exploring Venus.

The author believes even with all of the limitations, studying Venus could have so many benefits in the future. But another limitation is that hovering Venus at a safe distance might not give the insight on the conditions that people may need. Although he seems to be focusing on the negatives of it all, he brings in light to work around the limits. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for weeks in such conditions."" Here the author is bringing in the positives which ultimately outweigh the negatives. The limitations seemed to revolve around the harsh conditions, but the author introducing this peice of technology that would work around it helps support the authors ideas.

To conclude, the author has many doubts and fears about studying Venus, but remembers to tell about ways to work around the natural challenges the people would face. The authors idea that claims that studying venus is more important than the dangers pursuades many people into believing that as well. Finally, the author does a great job getting his point across.",0
"A machine identify human emotions doesn't seem to be valuable. The Facial Coding System is not nessesary for students in a classroom. Therefore, it just does not seem to benitficial to the students.

"" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" meaning everybody has there own way of expressing each others emotions. One can say that they are and another can say that they are sad. There's really no for need for a system to tell your expression at that time. You can obviously tell there expression. Plain and simple.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused of bored. Instead of the computer idenfitying the students emotions why doesn't a teacher actually go up the student to ask if everthing is fine and ask if he needs help on anything. Rather than a computer doing all the work. Not everybody is going to feel the same, but atleast it's worth a shot to try.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate. We already have enough of technology to do those kind of obsticales. That is a everyday thing for us humans. Why develop more technology that doesn't seem to be useful for your emotional expression. Students in classrooms don't even use there textbooks anymore, they now use ipads for online assignments and online textbooks. Technology is just overrated.

Echman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are some emotions that everybody has on everyday. A computer that identifies these expressions on a person is just not nessesary. A student can come to class knowing he or she is happy. The FACS is just in their way.

In conclusion, the FACS is just not valuable to students in classroom. It is much better if we just stop waisting money that e could use for something else. Like putting into education for students that actually want to learn rather than telling students what their emotional expression is by what a computer is reading. Therefore, it is not benitficial nor valuable.",0
"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever partygoers the most popular votes gets all of the electoral votes the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all of the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in a elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader.",0
"A new type technology was invented called Facil Action Coding System, this enables computers to identify human emotions. We have 44 major muscles in our face and by using a 3-D computer model it will help the computer better see your emotions. It's belived that by using computer codes to help see emotions can help at school. It could also help us with our personal life.

Psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS had six major emotions. '' Movement of one or more muscels is called an ''action unit''. The six major emotions are happy,surprise,anger,disdust,fear,and sadnees. When you are feeling sad, your face muscels change and when the computer see that change they know u are feeling sad.

When you are on the computer and your computer knows that you dont like an ad it will change to something differnt.''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''. This can help the teacher by helping sudents or pick up the pace so students dont get bored or confused. And most comunacation is non-verbal and by emotions.

This tecnology can also help us with our personal life as well as school. We can usually see if one of our friend is happy or sad we do this every day. So why do we need a computer to this for us. Well if we dont know the person we mught say something wrong. And with the help of tecnology we can better understand it. BY making the a little move on how you feel it can change your emotion.

The theory of emotions states that just smiling makes you happy and changes your whole mood. A drama coach says '' he had is actors reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of cresting these emotions on stage.'' Emotions have a way of changing techology helps us grow and help us.",0
"Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. Advantages such as, less pollution in the environment by creating less smog, making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, or even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. paragraph 5"" Cars are the number one cause of pollution in most cities, especially ones that have large amounts of drivers on the road in a single day. The author of source one, states in paragraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vaubanlike not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities"" All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the environment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving recklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. paragraph 6"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful environment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.",0
"The Unusual Rock Formation

When the ""Face of Mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""Face of Mars"" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""Face of Mars"".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?",0
"Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummented since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecissary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehical. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the envirnment dramtically. Because of the ussage of cars the envinment has been hugely effected. Since the envirnment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while excepltions were made for plug-in cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the envirnment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increse rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess envinments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the envirnment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the envirnment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe envirnment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe envirnment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.",0
"Dear Floridas state senator, I am righting this letter to tell you about why I think that we should ude the popular vote for the president of the United State. I have three main resons i would like to touch up on. It will give the poeple of the United States the chance to say who they want in the congree and say who we wnt to be our presedent. The Electoral College is not a democratic way of handleing it. But on the down side it can make things very unorganized, having us worry about every little person we have to put into congress.

In the United States we are a eaqual and fair contry, but with the Electoral College it does not us, the people of our fine nation the one to elect our presadent. It does not give us the freedom of making our own choices n who want to run our contry. But if we use the popular vote for the presadent of the united states it lets us, the people choose. It lets us the poeple the right to use our own opion and our own thought on who should run this country. Every person in this cutry has a voivce they do and they should be able to speak with thier voice.

If we use the Electoral Colledege it is not democratic. It does not let us the people choose. The Electoral Colledge baseecely sees that the citizens of our contrys opions do not matter. They are saying that the Electoral Colledges votes matter the most those are the only once we are worrying about. But thats not true our opion does matter, we are what make up this amazing cuntry not just the Electoral Colledge.

But you see there is up side to using the Electoral Colledge. It can keep us organized and what i mean by that is it will help the pople know who exactly all comes with the vote of the presedent. It also makes it alot esier to just vote for one group instead of voting for all 34 people. It will keep the people from accsadentaly voting for the wrong group. It will help the poeple make there desion on what they think best and not hat they have been told is the best choice.

The popoular vote for presadent is the best way to go. It gives the pople a voice and the Ellectoral Colledge isnt democratic. But the Electoral Colledge keep us, the people organized and helps us make the right decition.",0
"The advancement of technology has helped humanity a lot in several ways, such as comuters,phones or even, planes to travel the world. These advancements could help students to learn in school. The facial recognition mentioned in this article is amazing for the following reasons: it could give students an easier time understanding material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.

This facial recognition could help students understand their material better by molding the lesson if the student is confused or bored or possible even distracted. This would be immensely helpful for students who may have trouble comprehending certain subjects like math or English. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson,like an effective humn instructor.""

By shaping the lesson around the student it makes it more possible for a student to pass a class and graduate from highschool or college. If the student seems confused the lesson can slow down and work through the problem with them. If the student seems happy then the lesson can speed up and throw harder work at them.

Technology such as facial recognition in an acedemic situation could take the slowing down of harder classes and us that to drive new ideas of new technology into peoples heads. These programs could take calculus and make it to appleal to students with a mind for working with computers. This would open job oppurtunities for millions of people in the United States alone. It could take biology and slow the lesson to then advance it into so many different branches of biology.

Students get distracted; it's a thing that happens. what if it wasn't as easy to be distracted. what if your lesson shaped itsel ito something you liked because you undersood it, because you could make sense of what the lesson was about, and pllied it to real world situations. A lot of the reasons students get distracted is because they dont understand their subject or it's too hard so they stop to take abreak and dont come back to it baecause they know that they'll be just as confused when they come back to it as they were when they left. If your lesson slows down to incorporate your confused look or your stares of boredom it could mke the lesson easier to help you understand it which will in turn capture your attention again. I know multiple people who would love to have tis tech, myself included.

This would be an amazing advancemement in the acedemic worl but it's very far off. When this becomes widespread it would boost the economy of its country by a lot. I believe this technology would be beneficial for the following reasons: it would help students undertsand their material, it could introduce new ideas into peoples minds about career oppurtunities, and it could draw students focus into their work.",0
"NASA's scientists are adiment that ""the face on the mars"" is actually a face. First of all, why would there be a face ON THE GROUND. Do they really think that some nonexisting extra-terrestrial decided that he wanted to put his face on the ground and leave a mark that he was there? Probably not. Also, none of these ""faces"" actually look like a face. It looks like a rock fell or something.

Nothing about these pictures are authentic. If you look closely, it clearly is not a face. I'm not going to go into details and try to figure out what it is myself, but that is definitely not a face. This ""face"" is a natural landform . There are plenty of places on Earth that looks like faces, but are just patches or grass, or dirt.

How can NASA try and conclude that some life form decided to put their face print in the dirt? They really can't.

In conclusion, The face is not a face, for it is a natural landform. A rock must have fell on the mesa. But it will never be a face. Never has, and never will. Nobody has actually been on Mars to even back up this evidence, so what proof do they really have??",0
"The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote. Like for instance The Electoral college is not fair, but by voting with popular vote not only will more people vote but more people will vote for who they want to vote and not get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

Theres many reasons why the Electoral College isnt fair like, how Bradford Plumer stated during the 2000 campaign a variety of states that didnt vote because of not being able to see a campaign ad and they did that because some candidates dont focus on the states that they know theyre not gonna win. But by voting with popular vote you get to vote for who you want, everone gets to vote because every state would be equal and people would vote for the president and not for the slate of electors.

yes, maybe the Electoral College could be good for something for like winning. Also if you think about it, it could be worse like even worse than the 2000 fiasco election, and plus the Electoral College avoids run-off elections so thats a good thing if you want a clear winner.

Other than that popular vote is much more sufficient than Electoral vote because its much more fair and with popular vote everyone votes on who they want to vote and every state gets the same, equal treatment as the others.",0
"Use of FACS in the Classroom

Isn't it just the worst when you're frustrated with your homework, but your teacher doesn't seem to get the hint? This is why the Facial Action Coding System was created, or partly. The Facial Action Coding System would indeed be valuable if used in a classroom. It could be useful to kids, teachers, and parents of students. The FACS would be useful to change course of the lesson, or to help teachers decide on lesson plans for following years.

The FACS uses it's technology to evaluate the expression of Mona Lisa-- a painting. If the machine can figure out a non-living painting's emotion, then what could it do on humans? The FACS focuses on facial muscle movements to interpret the emotion of each item it scans. In the classroom, this could help kids by determining whether they understand. If a kid frowns, it can be obvious to the internet instructor that the student isn't understanding what they're being taught. The instructor can then go into deeper detail on how to finish a homework assignment.

In the case of boredom, it can help increase average scores. The software can determine whether a student is bored or not. If a student is bored, they will not pay much attention to the lesson, fall asleep, or maybe even shut it off. It is important to make sure the students are having some sort of fun with what they're being taught. The software could detect boredom and the online instructor would know to put more animations in the lesson, or even change the sounds and add music or a new polytone voice.

This software can also identify mixed emotions. If a student somewhat understands a lesson, but is also bored with it, the instructor knows to create a more lively detailed presentation. It's important to have a reader of mixed emotions in a classroom because of the amount of uncertainty in student's minds. It can also help the instructor know what lessons students understand and which ones they don't. The teachers can then decide what to do from then on, and/or next year, which ways the kids learn and which ways they don't.

The FACS is valuable in the classroom because teachers can change their lessons to fit each kids needs, and change their lessons for the following students next year. Each kid has their own personality, which requires different ways of learning. This software can almost guarantee improved scores in homework and tests because of how it helps teachers determine what the kids don't understand. Having the FACS in the classroom would deeply benefit the students, teachers, and parents. It would be the smartest choice to include this system into every student computer.",0
"It is becoming increasingly evident that there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage in modern society. The passage set provides several examples of communities and cities that are taking steps to reduce dependence on cars, and the positive outcomes they have experienced. Limiting car usage not only proves to be beneficial for the environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can effectively decrease these emissions and work towards combating climate change. The passage on Paris's driving ban due to smog highlights the positive impact of such measures. The ban resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels, improving the air quality and overall health of the city's residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, making transportation more efficient. The passage on the car-free day in Bogota showcases how millions of Colombians embraced alternative modes of transportation, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic jams. This not only saves time for commuters but also contributes to a more sustainable and accessible transportation system. By promoting alternatives such as walking, biking, and public transportation, cities can alleviate congestion, improve mobility, and enhance the overall quality of life for their residents.

Limiting car usage also encourages a shift towards more sustainable and healthy modes of transportation. The passage on Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how individuals can adopt a car-free lifestyle and experience increased happiness and reduced stress levels. This is further supported by the passage on the decrease in car ownership and driving in the United States. The trend suggests a cultural shift towards prioritizing alternative transportation options, such as walking or using public transportation, which can have positive impacts on physical and mental health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for urban planning to become more focused on the needs of residents rather than accommodating cars. By reducing the need for large parking areas, cities can prioritize creating community spaces, such as parks and pedestrian-friendly streets. This can enhance social interactions and create vibrant neighborhoods. The passage on Vauban's approach to smart planning emphasizes the placement of stores within walking distance, promoting pedestrian activity and reducing the need for long car trips to access essential amenities.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and diverse. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting sustainable and healthy transportation, and creating vibrant communities, limiting car usage proves to be a vital step in creating a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace this concept and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that encourage alternative modes of transportation.",1
"Are driverless cars really the future of transportation? Some say yes, while others are skeptical. Me, personally, I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. The article “Driverless Cars are Coming” by [author’s name] presents both the pros and cons of this technology, and I’m gonna use some of those details to argue against driverless cars.

First of all, let’s talk about the safety concerns. According to the article, driverless cars rely on sensors and software to navigate roads, which means that there’s a high risk of technical failure. Just imagine you’re cruising down the highway, and suddenly your car’s sensors malfunction, causing it to swerve into oncoming traffic. That’s a nightmare scenario that no one wants to experience. Plus, the article mentions that driverless cars might not be able to fully eliminate accidents caused by human error, since they’ll still have to share the road with human-driven vehicles. So, the safety benefits of driverless cars aren’t as clear-cut as some people claim.

Another issue with driverless cars is their potential impact on jobs. The article states that driverless cars could lead to a loss of jobs for human drivers, like truckers and taxi drivers. That’s a major concern, since these jobs provide livelihoods for millions of people. We shouldn’t just dismiss their interests and switch to a new technology without considering the consequences. It’s important to think about how this change will affect ordinary people and their families.

Furthermore, I think driverless cars will make us lose our driving skills. If we rely on cars to do all the work for us, we’ll forget how to drive ourselves. That might not seem like a big deal, but it’s important to have some basic skills, like being able to drive a car, in case of emergencies. What if there’s a blackout or a system failure? We’ll be helpless if we don’t know how to drive.

Finally, driverless cars just aren’t as fun as driving yourself. I know that some people might disagree, but for me, driving is a thrill. I enjoy the feeling of being in control of a car, the wind in my hair, and the freedom to go wherever I want. With driverless cars, that’ll all be gone. We’ll become passive passengers, relying on a machine to take us places instead of experiencing the joy of driving ourselves.

In conclusion, while some people might see driverless cars as the future, I think they’re a bad idea. There are too many safety concerns, job losses, and a loss of driving skills to make them worth it. And let’s not forget the fun of driving, which we’ll lose if we switch to driverless cars. So, let’s slow down and think carefully before embracing this technology. Maybe we should focus on improving public transportation or investing in electric cars instead. There are better ways to make transportation more efficient and sustainable without relying on driverless cars.",1
"Limiting Car Usage: Environmental and Community Benefits

There are significant advantages to limiting car usage through public policies and personal choices. Cars contribute greatly to air pollution and carbon emissions that damage both the environment and public health. By driving less and exploring alternatives like public transportation, biking, and walking, communities can become more sustainable while improving life for citizens. 

Transportation is a leading source of air pollution in most cities. Vehicular emissions contain nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants that degrade air quality (Source 1). These pollutants have been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular issues when inhaled regularly. Reducing car trips lowers these dangerous emissions and creates cleaner, healthier air for all to breathe. With even a modest reduction in driving, pollution levels would fall noticeably across urban and suburban areas.

In addition to local air quality impacts, limiting car usage helps address the global climate crisis. Transportation accounts for over a quarter of carbon emissions in developed nations, with personal vehicles being the primary culprit (Source 2). By choosing alternatives to solo driving, individuals can cut their carbon footprints significantly. If more people participated, the carbon savings would multiply. Slowing climate change through reduced driving protects both current communities and future generations from worsening environmental changes. 

Limiting car trips also has social and community benefits. With fewer vehicles on the road, streets become safer for cyclists and pedestrians alike. Neighborhoods often become more vibrant as more people opt to walk or bike for shorter trips rather than drive (Source 3). Public spaces also see more foot traffic, which can boost local businesses. Communities with robust bike lanes and public transportation networks report higher rates of resident activity and interaction. Reduced car dependency makes communities more livable while strengthening social ties.

In conclusion, limiting car usage provides clear advantages for both the environment and communities through improved air quality, climate change mitigation, and more vibrant public spaces. Small changes at the individual level, supported by smart public policies, can make a meaningful difference if adopted widely. Prioritizing alternatives to solo driving results in tangible benefits for public health, sustainability, and neighborhood life that strengthen communities for the future.",1
"The use of facial expression recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in classrooms could provide both benefits and risks when it comes to reading students' emotional expressions. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain valuable insights into how their students are feeling about different lessons, activities, or concepts. If a teacher can see that many students seem confused or bored during a particular part of a lesson, that feedback could help the teacher identify areas to reexplain or reteach to improve comprehension. Identifying students who appear frustrated early on may also help teachers intervene sooner with additional support. This type of emotional data collection could potentially help personalize instruction to better meet students' individual academic and emotional needs.

However, there are also valid concerns about continuously monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent. Due to issues beyond a teacher's control, like problems at home, a student may exhibit emotional reactions that do not truly reflect how well they are learning. Continuous surveillance of students' emotions could feel intimidating and damage teacher-student relationships if not implemented carefully. Students' facial expressions may also not always match their true inner feelings and thoughts on a subject. Relying too heavily on technology to interpret emotions could oversimplify the complex social and emotional dynamics in a classroom. 

Overall, using facial recognition to read students' emotions could provide useful insights for teachers if applied judiciously and only with students' knowledge and consent. But it is important that such technologies do not replace the human connection between teacher and student or damage students' sense of privacy and well-being in the learning environment. More research is still needed to fully understand both the benefits and risks of applying this type of technology in classrooms before wide adoption. Effective implementation would require balancing the need for feedback with protecting students' emotional privacy.",1
"Dear [Senator's name],

I am writing to you regarding the Electoral College system in the United States. I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place as it is a fair and effective way of electing our president.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that every state has an equal say in the election. The Founding Fathers created it to give smaller states a voice in the election, so that they would not be overshadowed by larger states. This system allows for a more balanced representation of the country.

Secondly, the Electoral College helps prevent a popular vote from being the sole determinant of the election. In a country as large and diverse as the United States, it is crucial that every state and every region is represented in the election. The Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a majority of the states, not just by the largest population centers.

Finally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected with a clear and decisive mandate. In a close election, the Electoral College can provide a clear winner and prevent a contested election.

I understand that some people may argue that the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not accurately represent the will of the people. However, I believe that the benefits of the Electoral College far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion on this important issue.

"Studying Venus is a Worthy Pursuit Despite Its Dangers

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case that studying Venus is worthwhile even given the planet's extremely hazardous environment. Through providing specific details about the scientific value of Venus exploration and technological advances that could mitigate risks, the author effectively supports their position that Venus research remains an important goal. 

Several key points in the article back up the author's stance. First, Venus remains one of the last unexplored worlds in our solar system, containing many mysteries about its formation and evolution. Comparing Venus to Earth could yield crucial insights into climate changes. The article notes how little is known about Venus' geology and chemistry despite being Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Resolving these unknowns would add significantly to our scientific understanding.

Next, the author points out technologies being developed to withstand Venus' conditions. Ideas like aerostat balloons and floating platforms could withstand heat and sulfuric acid rain without direct surface access. This shows how risk can be reduced through novel engineering. Probots are also proposed to be more durable than past Soviet landers. With creative solutions, dangers need not preclude all exploration. 

Finally, the article outlines the incremental approach many current Venus mission concepts utilize. Probing the atmosphere first allows gathering valuable data without immediately confronting the surface. Each small step builds experience for bolder steps later as technologies progress. Progress this incremental mitigates risk while still realizing scientific benefits. 

In conclusion, the author presents a convincing case through evidence that studying Venus remains worthwhile despite dangers. Providing compelling scientific motivations and discussing risk-reducing technologies, the article effectively supports its argument that Venus exploration is a pursuit deserving of continued efforts. With creativity and diligence, much remains to learn about our closest planetary neighbor.",1
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can greatly benefit society. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban due to smog highlights the negative consequences of car usage on air quality. The smog in Paris reached levels comparable to that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. This can have serious health implications for residents, as polluted air can lead to respiratory problems and other illnesses. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and promote better health outcomes for the population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help improve urban planning and create more sustainable communities. The passage about the German suburb, Vauban, shows how car-free streets and limited parking can create a more accessible and walkable community. This new approach to suburban life is being adopted globally, with the goal of making suburbs more compact and connected to public transportation. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing the dependence on cars, these communities become more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits. While there may be initial challenges and resistance, such as lost revenue for delivery companies, the long-term economic effects could be positive. The End of Car Culture passage mentions how car companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies. This shift in focus indicates a recognition of changing consumer behavior and a greater emphasis on alternative modes of transportation. In addition, the passage mentions that young people are driving less and becoming less interested in car ownership. This trend could have implications for the car industry, as fewer cars are being purchased. However, it also opens up opportunities for other sectors such as public transportation and shared mobility services.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, better urban planning, and potential economic benefits. By adopting smarter planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation options, and creating more walkable communities, we can reap these advantages and create a more sustainable future.",1
"While driverless cars offer many potential benefits, I have doubts about fully adopting this new technology. According to the article, driverless cars could significantly reduce traffic accidents since 90% are currently caused by human error. However, the technology is still in development and not proven to be flawless. There is always a risk of software or hardware malfunctions that could lead to accidents. Fully removing the human driver from the vehicle may have unintended safety consequences that have not been accounted for.  

The article also notes how driverless cars could improve mobility for those unable to drive such as the elderly or disabled. At the same time, replacing human drivers with AI systems could have significant economic impacts. Millions of jobs like transportation and delivery that rely on human drivers may be eliminated. The transition period as this new technology is adopted could create job losses and economic disruptions. There are also privacy concerns about how data collected while riding in driverless cars may be used or sold.

In conclusion, while driverless cars offer appealing benefits like reducing accidents and expanding mobility, the technology still faces uncertainties that make me hesitant to fully embrace replacing all human drivers just yet. More testing and progress is needed to address safety and economic concerns before driverless cars can become the new standard on our roads. For now, a cautious approach that balances both the promise and potential issues around this new technology seems most prudent.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give small states more influence, recent elections show that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote and legitimacy of presidential elections. 

Supporters of the Electoral College argue it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on a few populous states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates focus their campaigning only in swing states that could vote either way. This leaves voters in many non-competitive states feeling ignored. Popular vote would encourage candidates to seek support from people in all states, not just a handful of swing states. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might ignore issues important to small states. However, candidates would still need to consider a wide range of issues to appeal to a national majority. Moreover, smaller states still have equal representation in Congress to advocate for their priorities. Switching to a popular vote could increase voter turnout as more people would feel their ballots directly impact the outcome, and not just be symbolic votes in non-competitive states. 

While the Electoral College was designed to shield smaller states, it has not operated as intended and recent elections show it can undermine the one person, one vote principle. A national popular vote would make every vote equally important and encourage candidates to engage voters in all states. For these reasons, I believe changing to election by popular vote would strengthen our democratic system and the legitimacy of presidential elections. I hope you will consider supporting reform on this important issue.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the Electoral College system should be kept for electing the President of the United States, rather than changing to a popular vote. There are several important reasons why the Electoral College helps ensure that the president is chosen in a way that reasonably represents citizens around the country.

One concern about a popular vote is that candidates would only focus on campaigning in a few major population centers. This could diminish the political influence of smaller states and rural areas. The Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider geographic range of states. It encourages considering the interests of citizens in both small and large states. 

Critics point out that a presidential candidate could lose the national popular vote but win the Electoral College. However, it is also possible for a candidate to win the national popular vote but lose the presidency if their votes are concentrated only in a few states. The Electoral College system distributes electoral votes proportionally based on congressional representation in each state. This helps elect presidents who have support across multiple regions rather than just in densely populated areas.

It is also important to note that nearly 90% of voters live in what are considered “swing states” that could vote either way. These swing states receive disproportionate attention from candidates under both the current system and a popular vote system. Most states reliably vote the same way in presidential elections regardless of the system used. So changing to a national popular vote may not significantly change which states are targeted by candidates.

In conclusion, while some concerns are raised about the current Electoral College system, changing to a national popular vote could diminish participation and influence in many smaller states. The Electoral College encourages candidates to build broader coalitions across geographic regions. For these reasons, I believe the system should be kept in its current form. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College system for electing the president of the United States. The Electoral College system was created by the founding fathers to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election process. Without the Electoral College, larger states with more population would have all the power in choosing the president. This would be unfair to the smaller states and their citizens.

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the election. However, this has only happened five times in our history, and it is a rare occurrence. Moreover, the Electoral College system also ensures that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This ensures that the president is accountable to a diverse range of Americans, rather than just those in a few heavily populated areas.

Another argument against the Electoral College is that it can lead to electoral deadlocks. However, this has only happened once in our history, in the election of 1876. In that election, Samuel J. Tilden won the popular vote, but Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the presidency through a congressional commission. This was a rare occurrence, and it is unlikely to happen again.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system also encourages coalition building and compromise. Candidates must build support across different regions and states, which leads to a more diverse and representative government. This system also encourages voters to engage with the election process and to learn about the issues that affect different regions of the country.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College system is an important part of our democracy and should be kept in place. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, encourages coalition building and compromise, and ensures that the president is accountable to a diverse range of Americans. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College system and to vote against any measures that would aim to abolish it.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

As a high school student studying American government, I feel compelled to express my thoughts on the upcoming presidential election and the role of the Electoral College in determining the winner. As an individual, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose in our democracy, and I am writing to urge you to support maintaining the Electoral College system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that presidential elections remain fair and representative across all states, regardless of each state's population. Without the Electoral College system, candidates would only campaign in highly populated states, ignoring the smaller states and their issues. In this way, the Electoral College promotes fairness, as it gives equal weight to each state's electoral votes, regardless of their population size.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents the tyranny of the majority by requiring a candidate to win a broad majority of states to become president. It is a critical safeguard against a candidate winning the popular vote while ignoring the needs of smaller states or specific regions. This way, the system ensures that the winning candidate is representative of the entire country, not just a few states.

Furthermore, the current system ensures that the President-elect has won a clear mandate to govern. If the President-elect had only won the popular vote by a small percentage, as has happened in the past, they would not be able to govern effectively, as they would not have a clear mandate from the voters.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves many important purposes that cannot be overlooked. It promotes fairness, prevents the tyranny of the majority, and ensures that the President-elect has won a mandate to govern effectively. I urge you, therefore, to support maintaining this system.

"Hello, fellow citizens! Have you ever thought about the advantages of limiting car usage? I know it might seem like a strange idea at first, but hear me out.

First of all, let's talk about the environment. Cars produce a lot of pollution, which can be harmful to our planet. According to the passage set, cars produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air and help slow down climate change. Plus, less cars on the road means less noise pollution, which can make our communities quieter and more peaceful.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it's better for our health. Walking, biking, or using public transportation instead of driving can help us get more exercise and stay healthy. According to the passage set, physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to be more active and reduce their risk of these diseases.

Limiting car usage can also help our communities become more connected. When we walk or bike, we're more likely to interact with our neighbors and local businesses. We can say hi to each other, wave, or even stop and chat. This can help build a sense of community and make our neighborhoods feel more friendly and welcoming. According to the passage set, social connections are important for our mental health and well-being.

Finally, limiting car usage can save us money! According to the passage set, the cost of owning and maintaining a car can be really expensive. By using alternative modes of transportation, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and parking. Plus, many cities offer affordable public transportation options, which can be a cheaper alternative to driving.

So, what can we do to limit car usage? One idea is to encourage alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transportation. We can also promote carpooling or using ride-sharing services. Additionally, we can support policies that discourage driving, like increasing parking fees or implementing congestion pricing.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages, including reducing pollution, improving our health, building stronger communities, and saving us money. By making a few changes to our daily routines, we can make a big difference in the long run. So, let's try to reduce our reliance on cars and make our communities healthier, quieter, and more connected. Thank you for reading!",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College. As a sixth grader, I have been learning about the Electoral College and its role in the presidential election process. After careful consideration, I believe that it is in the best interest of our country to keep the Electoral College.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College is because it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, the larger states with more population would have more power and influence over the outcome of the election. This would leave smaller states with little to no say in the matter. The Electoral College ensures that each state has a certain number of electoral votes, regardless of its population, giving smaller states a fair chance to have their voices heard.

Another reason I believe the Electoral College is beneficial is that it encourages candidates to campaign across the country, not just in densely populated areas. With a popular vote system, candidates would only need to focus on the largest states and cities, leaving smaller communities and rural areas ignored. The Electoral College forces candidates to consider the needs and concerns of voters in all states, not just those with the most population.

I also want to address the counterclaim that the Electoral College is undemocratic. While it is true that the Electoral College can sometimes result in a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes, this does not necessarily mean it is undemocratic. The Electoral College is a system that was put in place by our founding fathers to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the election. It is not a perfect system, but it has worked for over two centuries and has allowed our country to elect presidents that have served our nation well.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the president of the United States. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and encourages candidates to campaign across the country, not just in densely populated areas. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and to resist any efforts to switch to a popular vote system.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as a method to elect the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a necessary compromise that ensures a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

Firstly, the Electoral College offers a certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner must have broad support across different regions, rather than just winning the popular vote in a few densely populated areas. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and encourages them to campaign throughout the country, understanding the concerns and needs of various regions.

Secondly, the Electoral College guarantees that every region and state has a voice in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal. By requiring candidates to garner support from all parts of the country, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than a few concentrated populations.

Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in each state incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. These states, where the race is close and the outcome uncertain, receive the most attention from candidates. This encourages voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign, listen to the competing candidates, and make more informed decisions. The Electoral College promotes engagement and thoughtful voting among citizens.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores balance in the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. The Electoral College balances this by ensuring that larger states receive more attention from candidates. It prevents candidates from solely catering to the interests of densely populated areas and encourages consideration of the concerns and needs of less populous regions as well.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This is particularly important in a diverse and pluralistic society like ours, where establishing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting preserves stability and reduces the complications of the election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters are motivated to express their political preference, not solely to decide an election with a single vote. The Electoral College does not diminish the importance of individual voters but rather ensures that the collective voice of the American people is accurately represented.

In conclusion, the Electoral College strikes a balance between a direct popular vote and election by Congress. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all Americans, encourages engagement and thoughtful voting, balances the power of different states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method to elect the President of the United States.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my view. I trust that you will take this into account when deciding on the future of our electoral system.

"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College system, rather than switching to election by popular vote, is crucial for protecting our democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states within the country.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The allocation of electors is based on each state's Congressional delegation, providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. Due to the winner-take-all system employed by most states, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the outcome of the election, as the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes is declared the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote could potentially lead to prolonged disputes and recounting of votes, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is the need for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across various regions and build a broad coalition of support. In turn, this helps to ensure that the winning candidate has national appeal and can effectively represent the interests of the entire country. Without this requirement, there is a risk of a candidate with only regional appeal winning the presidency, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system places importance on swing states, thereby granting more attention to the issues and concerns of those states. Campaign efforts are concentrated in toss-up states, which leads to increased engagement and thoughtful voting among their residents. This ensures that swing states, and the diverse perspectives they represent, play a significant role in deciding the election outcome.

The Electoral College also helps to restore balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the Senate provides representation for small states through equal representation, the Electoral College allows large states to have a greater say in the election. This balance is crucial for ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of heavily populated areas but also consider the interests of smaller states.

Lastly, the use of the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This prevents additional complexity in the election process and ensures a clear winner is determined.

While there are arguments for switching to a direct popular vote, it is important to note that such a change would undermine the principles on which our electoral system was built. The Electoral College helps to maintain a balance of power between states, encourages broader national campaigns, and ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides essential benefits including certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, balance of power between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the democratic principles and ensure fair representation for all states within our great nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and continue to support its retention in our presidential elections.

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which the President of the United States is elected. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote.

One of the key reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the outcome of the election is clear and reduces the likelihood of disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to closer margins and potential disputes over results, as evident in the 2000 election.

Another important consideration is that the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. Judge Posner highlights that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the election and potentially neglecting the interests of other regions. In this way, the Electoral College promotes a more unified and balanced representation.

Additionally, the focus on swing states in the electoral system encourages candidates to campaign and connect with voters across the country. As mentioned by Judge Posner, candidates direct their efforts towards toss-up states, where voters are more attentive and engaged in the political process. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who closely consider the candidates' messages, have a significant impact on the election outcome. It encourages candidates to address issues that are relevant to a wide range of voters, rather than solely appealing to the interests of densely populated areas.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a system that proportionately recognizes the influence of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large states, as they receive more attention from candidates due to their larger number of electoral votes. This prevents a situation where candidates solely focus on the needs of highly-populated areas, thus allowing for a more diverse representation of interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time and resources by providing a clear winner and preventing the possibility of extended election cycles. The integrity of the election process is maintained, and the transition of power is smoother and more efficient.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained due to its ability to provide a clear outcome, promote trans-regional representation, encourage candidate engagement across all states, proportionately recognize the importance of large and small states, and prevent run-off elections. While the popular vote may seem appealing, it is important to consider the practical benefits and safeguards that the Electoral College offers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to carefully consider the advantages outlined above when evaluating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards reducing reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation. This trend is supported by evidence from various sources, including articles such as ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. 

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution (Rosenthal). According to the article, car emissions account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive effects on people's overall well-being and quality of life. In the article about the German suburb, Vauban, residents expressed how giving up their cars has made them happier and less stressed (Rosenthal). The reliance on cars can lead to congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, people can have shorter and more enjoyable commutes. This can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle, as walking and biking provide opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities.

Furthermore, reducing car usage can have economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to address the issue of smog, and the congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent (Duffer). This shows that limiting car usage can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, which in turn can lead to time and cost savings for individuals and businesses. Additionally, by encouraging alternative modes of transportation, cities can reduce the need for extensive car infrastructure and parking spaces, freeing up valuable land for other purposes (Rosenthal).

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve people's well-being, promote a healthier lifestyle, and have economic benefits. As demonstrated by examples from Germany, Paris, and Bogota, adopting smart planning strategies and promoting alternative modes of transportation can lead to successful and sustainable communities. It is important for citizens and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that support this shift.",1
"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and offers significant benefits.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, ""The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winner of the Electoral College typically receives a higher share of the electoral vote compared to their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and reduces the likelihood of disputes or uncertainty surrounding the election results.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it fosters the notion of ""everyone's president."" With its requirement of trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning particular regions. This ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous areas. By avoiding a situation where candidates can win the presidency by appealing only to specific regions, the Electoral College promotes the well-rounded leadership that our country needs.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. In his article, Judge Posner explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This forces candidates to listen to and engage with voters in these states, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns and priorities of these crucial states are addressed.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for the inclusion of larger states in the presidential election process. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution means that larger states lose weight in terms of political balance. The Electoral College helps to balance this by providing a mechanism for larger states to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account, promoting a more inclusive democracy.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. With its winner-take-all approach, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner without the need for further rounds of voting. This eliminates the complexity and potential complications that may arise from run-off elections and allows for a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy. It ensures the certainty of outcome, fosters a president for everyone, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the system is not perfect, it offers significant advantages over a direct popular vote. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system as it plays a vital role in our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the information presented in this letter when formulating your stance on this issue.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to advocate for maintaining the current Electoral College system. While many argue for a switch to the popular vote, I believe considering all factors, the Electoral College presents a more reliable and fairer path for determining the president of the United States.

The founding fathers decided on the Electoral College because it involved both the citizens voting and Congress electing the president (Office of the Federal Register 1). The system ensures that a candidate needs to appeal across a wide geographic range, preventing the domination of specific regions and perpetuating political diversity in different states. In other words, it means that no region has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a president (Posner 19), which discourages candidates from focusing solely on highly populated states and neglecting smaller ones.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that the system gives ""too much weight to less populated states"" (Plumer 13). Yet it is essential to stress that in the Electoral College mechanism, large states have the advantage due to their weightier voting blocs (Posner 21). This balance accords states with smaller populations with a sense of significance and encourages candidates to garner national appeal rather than regional.

Additionally, the Electoral College circumvents the confusion and political upheaval that could result from an absence of a clear majority vote. In the event where no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, the system invariably produces a clear winner, thereby avoiding the complication of organizing possible run-off elections (Posner 22).

Plumer argues that the Electoral College could result in scenarios that contradict the will of the people, citing Nixon and Kennedy's close call (Plumer 11). However, Posner mentions that such situations are rare, further emphasizing the usual congruity between Electoral College and the popular vote (Posner 16).

Plumer also points out the inequity of the “winner-take-all” system, where candidates overlook some states (Plumer 13). Posner, however, contends that swing states, due to their unpredictable voting habits, draw the candidates' attention, making them the most informed voters (Posner 20). This implies a ""true democracy,"" where the most thoughtful voters decide the election.

While the process isn’t perfect and could deter potential voters from casting their votes in “safe states” (Posner 23), one might argue that it still encourages a democratic habit, forcing citizens to voice out their political stance.

In conclusion, despite the Electoral College's criticisms, the benefits it brings in maintaining nationwide balance and preventing electoral chaos justify retaining the current system.

Yours faithfully,

"Support for the Electoral College System

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States, as I believe it is a fundamental aspect of our democratic process. While there are arguments to be made for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the popular vote result, as even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral victory. In a democracy, it is crucial to have a clear winner in order to maintain stability and legitimacy in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on their own. As a result, candidates are motivated to campaign across various states and address the concerns of voters from different regions. This helps to prevent the marginalization of certain regions and ensures that the president is a representative of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system benefits swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states pay closer attention to the candidates and their policies. These voters are often more thoughtful and engaged, which leads to a more informed electorate and a potentially more effective president being elected.

The Electoral College also gives importance to large states. In the United States, the Senate is apportioned in a way that gives smaller states more representation. The Electoral College system helps to balance this by giving larger states more attention from candidates during their campaigns. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are considered when electing the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a run-off election may be necessary. This would complicate the electoral process and create additional uncertainty. The Electoral College system consistently produces a clear winner, making the transition of power smooth and unambiguous.

While some argue that the Electoral College system is unfair to voters, it is important to note that voters in non-swing states still have their voices heard through the selection of electors. Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in different states, ensuring that diverse perspectives and concerns are represented in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, despite its imperfections, remains a crucial aspect of our democratic process. Its advantages in ensuring certainty of outcome, encouraging trans-regional appeal, benefiting swing states, giving importance to large states, and avoiding run-off elections demonstrate its suitability for our nation. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College system for the sake of our democracy and the fair representation of all Americans.

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. This is evident in various examples from different countries around the world. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle, with 70% of families choosing not to own cars. This has resulted in a more relaxed and happier community, as residents no longer have to deal with the stress and tension that comes with car ownership. Additionally, limiting car usage is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major concern in Europe and the United States.

Private cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and car-intensive areas in the United States. By separating suburban life from auto use, smart planning initiatives aim to reduce this environmental impact. Vauban serves as an example of this approach, with its car-free streets and limited parking spaces. This model is being adopted in various countries to make suburbs more accessible to public transportation and reduce the reliance on cars. By placing stores within walking distance and creating a more compact community, the need for cars is minimized.

The United States is also starting to recognize the need for car-reduced communities. The Environmental Protection Agency is actively promoting this concept, and legislators are taking small steps towards making suburbs less car-dependent. Public transport is expected to play a larger role in future transportation bills. In past bills, the majority of funds were allocated to highways, but there is a growing understanding of the need to invest in alternative modes of transportation.

The success of these initiatives can be seen internationally as well. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. Congestion decreased by 60% during the ban, demonstrating the impact that limiting car usage can have on air pollution. Similarly, Bogota in Colombia has implemented a car-free day, which has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. The event has even inspired other cities and countries to adopt similar initiatives.

The decrease in car usage in the United States is evident in recent studies, which suggest that Americans are driving fewer miles and buying fewer cars. This shift in behavior is not just a result of the recession but appears to be a long-term trend. Factors such as the internet allowing for telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of car-pooling apps have all contributed to a decrease in car dependency. This cultural shift, if it continues, will have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may pose challenges for the car industry.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing stress, improving air quality, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The examples from German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in creating more sustainable and livable communities. Additionally, the decrease in car usage in the United States indicates a cultural shift towards alternative forms of transportation. It is important for individuals and communities to embrace this change and continue working towards a future with reduced car dependence.",1
"As a responsible and concerned citizen, I strongly believe that limiting car usage is essential for the well-being of our community and the environment. The advantages of reducing car usage are numerous and backed by various sources, which I will outline in this essay.

First and foremost, limiting car usage significantly reduces air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is a major environmental risk factor for premature death, responsible for an estimated 7 million deaths worldwide in 2012. Cars and other vehicles are a significant contributor to air pollution, emitting harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution and protect the health of our community.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. According to a study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average commuter in the United States spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic, which costs the economy $124 billion in lost productivity and wasted fuel. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion, decrease travel times, and increase productivity.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can encourage physical activity and improve the overall health of our community.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the transportation sector is responsible for 23% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with cars being a significant contributor. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, reduce our carbon footprint, and help combat climate change.

Finally, limiting car usage can save money and promote sustainable development. According to a study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the average cost of owning and maintaining a car is over $8,000 per year. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce the financial burden on individuals and families, and promote sustainable development.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is essential for the well-being of our community and the environment. By reducing air pollution, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting physical activity and health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and saving money, we can create a more sustainable and healthy community. I urge our fellow citizens to join us in this effort and embrace alternative modes of transportation for a better future.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can offer numerous advantages to both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing the reliance on cars, not only can we improve the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we can also create more sustainable and livable communities. The passages provided highlight examples from various countries where limiting car usage has been implemented successfully.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, with some areas in the United States reporting emissions as high as 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate climate change. In Paris, for example, a driving ban was enforced to combat high levels of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality (Robert Duffer).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable and compact communities. The article mentions Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally not allowed. As a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars and 57 percent had sold their cars to move to this community. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Elisabeth Rosenthal). This approach is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, with the aim of making suburbs more accessible to public transportation and reducing the need for extensive parking spaces (Elisabeth Rosenthal).

Limiting car usage also promotes alternative transportation options and reduces traffic congestion. Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day, during which millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. The event not only reduced traffic jams, but also demonstrated the feasibility of promoting alternative transportation modes and reducing smog (Andrew Selsky). By providing infrastructure and incentives for walking, cycling, and using public transportation, cities can encourage people to choose these modes of transportation, resulting in less congested roads and more efficient transportation networks.

In addition to the aforementioned benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to improved public health. By reducing car dependence, people are more likely to engage in physical activity through walking or cycling, which in turn can lead to improved cardiovascular health and lower rates of obesity. Furthermore, the decrease in air pollution from fewer cars on the road can contribute to better respiratory health for individuals living in car-restricted areas.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It can help combat climate change, create more sustainable communities, reduce traffic congestion, and improve public health. These benefits have already been observed in various countries where such measures have been implemented successfully. By prioritizing alternative transportation modes and creating spaces that are less reliant on cars, we can create a more environmentally-friendly and livable future.",1
"Title: The Case for Limited Car Usage: Improving Environmental and Urban Health

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold, promoting healthier societies as well as a more sustainable environment. The experiences of cities such as Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota, in conjunction with emerging attitudes in the United States towards car ownership, underscore these benefits.

To understand the primary driver behind this shift, one must consider environmental concerns. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions; passenger cars account for 12 percent of such emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the U.S. (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb""). In order to curb these harmful emissions, some urban areas have started planning smart, low-car suburbs with limited parking spaces and improved access to public transportation. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, for instance, has successfully executed this model, with 70 percent of its residents opting not to own cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb"").

The experience of Paris offers a stark cautionary tale of high car dependency. In response to a severe smog crisis, the French capital had to enforce a partial driving ban, causing considerable disruption but resulting in a significant decrease in air pollution (Duffer). The driving ban also underscored the potentially salutary effects of limiting car usage on urban air quality, as seen in other cities as well. 

As Colombians have demonstrated, limiting car usage doesn’t mean giving up a mobile lifestyle entirely. During Bogota’s “Day Without Cars,” millions of residents turned to bikes and public transportation for commuting, effectively reducing air pollutants while promoting physical health and community solidarity (Selsky).

Meanwhile, in the United States, a cultural shift appears to be under way with increasing numbers of Americans buying fewer cars and driving less frequently (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture""). This cultural change isn't solely rooted in environmental concerns; improved urban planning, the rise in telecommuting, and better access to public transportation have also contributed to the shift (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"").

All these examples underline the multiple advantages of limiting car usage. Not only does this lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it also fosters healthier, more vibrant urban communities. By making the choice to drive less, citizens can contribute to the well-being of their cities and the planet, encouraging a sustainable lifestyle for the future generations. By supporting policies that promote alternative modes of transportation and planning smart, low-car suburban lives, we can accelerate this beneficial transition. In the balance are not just our suburbs and cities but also the planet's future.",1
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a cutting-edge technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. As described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and understand human emotions. However, the question remains whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

On the one hand, using FACS in the classroom can provide teachers with valuable insights into their students' emotional states. This information can help teachers identify students who may be struggling or feeling overwhelmed, allowing them to provide additional support and guidance. It can also help teachers assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods and make adjustments to better engage their students. Moreover, FACS can help create a more positive and inclusive learning environment by enabling teachers to recognize and address any biases or discrimination that may be present in the classroom.

On the other hand, there are several concerns surrounding the use of FACS in the classroom. Firstly, there is the issue of privacy. Students may feel uncomfortable having their facial expressions monitored and analyzed by computers, and this could potentially create a sense of mistrust and discomfort in the classroom. Additionally, there is the risk of false positives or false negatives, where the technology misinterprets a student's emotional expression or fails to recognize it altogether. This could lead to misinformation and inappropriate interventions, which could ultimately harm the student.

Furthermore, relying too heavily on FACS could lead to a lack of human interaction and empathy in the classroom. Teachers are trained to recognize and respond to their students' emotions, and this technology could potentially replace that human connection. It is important for students to feel heard and understood by their teachers, and relying solely on technology to interpret their emotions could undermine this.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in the classroom has the potential to be valuable, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of this technology. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of FACS and the need for human interaction and empathy in the classroom. By using FACS in a responsible and nuanced way, we can create a more positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.",1
"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I am writing as a concerned citizen of our great state of [Your State]. I write to you today to voice my support for maintaining the Electoral College system, utilized since the inception of our great nation, to elect our presidents. While some argue this system is outdated, its continued use ensures a more balanced representation across the country, which is a paramount democratic principle.

The Electoral College system was introduced by our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of Federal Registrar). The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures a balanced representation where regions do not have enough electoral votes to elect a president single-handedly thus requiring a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal (Posner).

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair to voters as candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the “swing” states (Plumer). However, the Electoral College system mitigates the risk of regionalism because a single region never possesses enough electoral votes to elect a president (Posner). This ensures every region of our vast and diverse country has its voice heard and its interests taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College also allows elections to avoid complications possibly coming from a candidate not receiving a majority of votes, since it usually produces a clear winner (Posner).

Some also argue that the Electoral College is unfair since it allows for a president to be elected without winning the popular vote, as seen during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush (Plumer). While this case indicates the possibility of such occurrences, they rarely happen, and are a small price to pay for maintaining fair representation of all regions of our vast country (Posner).

Maintaining the Electoral College system also helps prevent a crisis in the event of a tie vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible but highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all basis state electoral votes (Posner). There is stark certainty in results since the winners' Electoral College vote usually surpass their popular vote  (Posner).

In conclusion, while the implementation of a national popular vote may seem appealing on the surface, a deeper exploration shows us that the Electoral College is an essential system to our democracy. It represents the very essence of our federalism and provides a balance of power ensuring all citizens, regardless of their geographic location, have a voice. Therefore, I firmly stand with the continuation of the Electoral College and I hope you can take this into consideration when such issues arise in the Senate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"The Rise of Driverless Technology  

The development of driverless cars promises both great benefits and dangers that need serious consideration. While autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents and increase mobility, their widespread adoption poses risks that must be addressed. On balance, driverless cars should be developed, but under careful regulation and oversight.

According to the article, driverless cars hold potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error. An estimated 90% of crashes today are due to human choices like speeding, distraction, impairment. Removing the human element could prevent thousands of injuries and deaths each year by allowing cars to drive more safely and avoid hazards. The elderly and disabled who cannot currently drive may also gain new independence with autonomous transportation.

However, the article also notes serious cybersecurity concerns. As cars become more computerized, they could potentially be hacked or systems could fail unexpectedly. An attack could cause multiple crashes simultaneously or allow remote manipulation of vehicles. Developers must prioritize security updates and ensure no unauthorized access is possible. Additional issues involve how the vehicles will handle emergency situations and share roads with human drivers. 

While the benefits of driverless cars to transportation and public safety are compelling, these risks demonstrate the need for careful testing and monitoring by government agencies before widespread adoption. Developers must work closely with regulators to address cyber concerns through system design and redundant safeguards. Autonomous vehicles should also undergo rigorous simulated emergency scenarios and closed track testing with human drivers before use on open roads. With proper precautions to resolve outstanding issues, driverless technology has potential to be developed and deployed safely for the benefit of society. Overall, this progress shows promise if matched with thoughtful policy to oversee new automobile technologies.",1

"The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a presidential election by popular vote. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits and is a crucial part of our democratic system.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. This principle is extremely important in minimizing potential disputes over the outcome of an election, as was seen in the 2000 election, when the popular vote winner did not win the presidency. With the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of post-election controversies.

Another reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is everyone's president. With no region having enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president, candidates are required to have trans-regional appeal. This means that they must reach out to a broad range of voters across different regions, rather than focusing solely on regions where they have the highest support. By promoting candidates with nationwide appeal, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the interests of diverse regions and populations are represented in the presidency.

The swing state system, facilitated by the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, is another important aspect of the Electoral College that should be preserved. In states with a close race, candidates are compelled to focus their campaign efforts and resources on these swing states, where a small margin of votes can tip the electoral balance. This incentivizes candidates to listen to and address the concerns of swing state voters, leading to a more informed and engaged electorate. Moreover, swing state voters are often more thoughtful voters, as they receive the most attention and information from the candidates during the campaign.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance between big and small states. While large states lose representation in the Senate due to mal-apportionment, the Electoral College grants them more attention from presidential candidates. A close popular vote in a large state can result in a significant number of electoral votes, compared to a small state with a similar margin of victory. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on campaigning in highly populated regions, but also engage with voters from various states, regardless of their population size.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. With the current system, a clear winner is almost always determined, as opposed to situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Run-off elections can be time-consuming and complicated, potentially undermining the efficiency and effectiveness of the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the voter turnout in our country continues to be substantial. About half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite their individual votes having limited impact on the national outcome. Citizens vote to express their political preferences and contribute to the democratic process, rather than with the expectation that their vote will single-handedly decide an election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well by providing certainty of outcome, ensuring that the president is everyone's president, promoting engagement in swing states, balancing representation between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Replacing it with a popular vote system would undermine these important benefits. I strongly urge you to consider the significance of these arguments and support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my perspective. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our nation.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider retaining this system for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important advantages that should be preserved.

One of the main arguments for the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcome. In a winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. This was demonstrated in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all method ensures that even a slight majority in a state can lead to a significant electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of “everyone’s president.” Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country, engaging with voters from various regions and considering their diverse interests. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being successful presidents and helps avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of states where candidates focus less of their campaign efforts.

The Electoral College's focus on swing states also benefits the electoral process and encourages thoughtful voting. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, which leads to increased engagement and attention from voters in these swing states. These voters are often more informed and more likely to pay attention to the candidates' messages. Allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election ensures that the election outcome reflects the will of the well-informed citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives due weight to large states. Since the Electoral College is based on the number of congressional representatives, larger states have more influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system. This balance is crucial in redressing the power imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing greater attention to large states during campaigns, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns of a wider range of citizens and ensure that their interests are represented.

Lastly, by avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College simplifies the presidential election process. Run-off elections, which would be necessary if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, could greatly complicate the process and prolong the period of uncertainty. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures a smooth transition of power and avoids potential complications associated with unresolved elections.

While some argue that a popular vote system would increase voter participation, research shows that voters in presidential elections are motivated to express their political preferences rather than exert decisive influence over the outcome. The Electoral College does not discourage participation but rather focuses it on expressing preferences rather than choosing a winner.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers important advantages that should be preserved. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting through swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids run-off elections. While it is not a perfect system, it has demonstrated its resilience and ability to maintain the integrity of the election process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the retention of the Electoral College for future presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"The Open Ocean Adventure Awaits

As a lifelong cowboy from rural Australia, I never imagined the adventures that awaited me when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. Having spent my days riding across sweeping plains, the idea of navigating raging seas was almost unthinkable. Yet the opportunity to experience new cultures and places unlike any I had known was too intriguing to pass up. Now, having had the journey of a lifetime, I cannot recommend the program enough to fellow adventurers seeking fresh horizons. 

Participating in Seagoing Cowboys opened my eyes to the beauty of coastlines around the world. From breathtaking cliffs in Ireland to the untouched beaches of distant islands, I was struck by the raw majesty of oceans. Each new shore also offered glimpses into varied ways of life. Assisting fishermen in Greece taught me respect for their resilience and craft, while Alaska's First Nations people generously shared insights into ancestral traditions. Connecting with communities so different than my own sparked reflections on our shared humanity. 

Along with scenic sights and cultural exchanges, memorable moments of high seas daring-do keep me reminiscing. Riding monster waves that seemed to reach the sky in New Zealand tested my nerve but filled me with exhilaration. Navigating treacherous passages around Antarctica left me in awe of brilliant icy landscapes and the program's skilled captains. Fending off storms proved we cowboys don't shy from rain or waves. Such experiences of triumph over nature's forces are the type of adventures nobody can take from you.

For anyone seeking to break out of a routine and embrace life's great unknown, I believe Seagoing Cowboys provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One journey with the program broadened my horizons more than I ever thought possible. The open ocean awaits with marvels around every bend to inspire you to keep pushing boundaries, just as it did for me. I recommend venturing forth to join us cowboys riding not just across plains but waves, too. The career-defining memories will stay with you forever.",1
"Introduction:
The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with this idea and believe that the author does a good job of supporting it.

Body:
One piece of evidence that supports the author's idea is the potential benefits of studying Venus. The author states that Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, making it a prime candidate for studying the effects of runaway greenhouse gas emissions. This is important because it could help us better understand the impact of human activities on Earth's climate and potentially prevent a similar catastrophe from happening here. Additionally, the author notes that studying Venus could provide valuable insights into the development of life on Earth and potentially even reveal evidence of extraterrestrial life. These potential benefits make the risks of exploring Venus worth it.

Another piece of evidence that supports the author's idea is the technological advancements that have been made in recent years. The author notes that new technologies have been developed to study Venus from a safe distance, such as the use of aerial platforms and balloons. These technologies allow scientists to gather data and conduct experiments without putting humans in harm's way. This reduces the risks associated with exploring Venus and makes it more feasible to conduct long-term studies.

Finally, the author's use of rhetorical questions helps to emphasize the importance of studying Venus. The author asks questions such as, ""What would we learn if we could study the surface of Venus up close?"" and ""What would we gain from studying the planet's atmosphere and climate?"" These questions encourage the reader to think critically about the potential benefits of studying Venus and to consider the potential impact of such studies on our understanding of the universe.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The potential benefits of studying Venus, the technological advancements that have been made, and the use of rhetorical questions all contribute to a strong argument. While there are certainly risks associated with exploring Venus, the potential rewards make it a worthwhile endeavor.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the current system of electing the President of the United States. As a high school student, I have been learning about the Electoral College and the debate surrounding it. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be kept in place.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This is evident in the 2016 presidential election, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin, but Donald Trump won the presidency due to his victories in key battleground states. This system ensures that the President is accountable to voters in all states, rather than just those in heavily populated areas.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it was established by the Founding Fathers as a way to balance the power between large and small states. As stated in the article ""The Electoral College: A 2020 Perspective"" by Tara Ross, ""The Founders wanted to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the election process, and that the President would be accountable to all citizens, not just those in the most populous areas."" This system ensures that smaller states have a say in the election, and that the President is accountable to all citizens, not just those in heavily populated areas.

I also believe that the Electoral College system encourages coalition building and compromise. Candidates must build support across different regions and demographics in order to win the presidency. This leads to a more diverse and representative government, as stated in the article ""The Electoral College: A 2020 Perspective"" by Tara Ross, ""The Electoral College encourages coalition building and compromise, which leads to a more diverse and representative government.""

I understand that some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and that a popular vote system would be more fair. However, I believe that a popular vote system would lead to candidates focusing solely on heavily populated areas, ignoring the needs and concerns of smaller states and rural communities. This would lead to a less representative government, and would undermine the principles of federalism that our country was founded upon.

In conclusion, I urge you to keep the Electoral College system in place. It ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, balances the power between large and small states, and encourages coalition building and compromise. I believe that this system is fundamental to the functioning of our democracy and that it has served our country well for over two centuries.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"As a studnet in grade 11, I belive that the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read the emotinal expressions of students in a clasroom is a valuable tool for teatchers. The FACS technology, as desribed in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" allows compeuters to identify human emotions by analyzing facial expresions. By using this technology, teatchers can gain a better understading of their students' emotinal states, which can help them to adjust their teaching methods to better meet the needs of their students.

One of the main benifits of using FACS in the clasroom is that it allows teatchers to identefy students who may be strugling emotionally. For example, if a student is exhibiting a facial expression that indacates boredom or confusin, the teatcher can adjust their lesson plan to make it more engageing and easier to understand. This can help to improve the overall learning experiance for the student and can lead to better acdemic perforamnce.

Another benifit of FACS is that it can help teatchers to identefy students who may be experiencing diffficult emotions, such as anxiety or sadness. By recognizing these emotions, teatchers can provide the necesary support and resources to help the student manage their emotions and succeed in the classroom. This can be especialy importint for students who may be dealing with personal issuses, such as bullying or family problems, that can affect their ability to learn.

Furthermore, FACS can also be used to evaluete the effectiveness of different teaching methods. By analyzing the facial expresions of students during different lessons, teatchers can identefy which methods are most engageing and effective, and which ones may need to be adjusted. This can help teatchers to refine their teaching practises and provide the best possible learning experiance for their students.

However, it is also importint to consider the potential drawbacks of using FACS in the clasroom. Some students may feel uneasy about being monitored by a computer, and this could potentially affect their ability to learn. Additionally, there may be concerns about the accuracy of the technology, as facial expressions can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as lighting conditions or cultural differences.

To address these concerns, it is important for teatchers to be transparent about the use of FACS and to obtain the consent of their students before using it. Teatchers should also be trained to interpret the data provided by FACS correctly, and to use it in a way that is respectful and ethical.

In conclusion, the use of FACS to read the emotinal expressions of students in a clasroom is a valuable tool for teatchers. It can help to improve the learning experiance, identefy students who may be strugling emotionally, and evaluete the effectiveness of different teaching methods. However, it is also importint to consider the potential drawbacks and to use the technology in a responsible and ethical way. By doing so, teatchers can create a more positive and supportive learning environment for their students.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical method for electing the President of the United States. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. The process of selecting electors, the meeting of these electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress ensure a fair and constitutionally sound election process. The Electoral College has been successfully used for centuries and changing it would require significant modifications to the Constitution.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote and ensures a clear outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the popular vote is more probable than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. Therefore, maintaining the Electoral College ensures a more stable and predictable election process.

In addition, the Electoral College promotes representation of all regions in the United States. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning specific regions and encourages them to campaign across the entire country. It ensures that the interests and concerns of all regions are taken into account in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states. This system incentivizes candidates to dedicate more attention and resources to states where the election outcome is uncertain. As a result, voters in these swing states are more likely to be engaged and informed about the candidates' positions and policies. Their thoughtful votes should have a significant influence in deciding the election, and the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the power among small and large states. The system helps to restore some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, the Electoral College allows large states to receive more attention from presidential candidates compared to small states. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and interests of diverse states, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and effective.

While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, such as greater fairness to voters and increased attention to all states, the existing system of the Electoral College has proven to be functional, practical, and has multiple advantages that outweigh these potential benefits.

In conclusion, it is important to maintain the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a valuable and effective system. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to the electoral process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our nation and its citizens.

"The Development of Driverless Cars 

While driverless cars present exciting new technological possibilities, their widespread adoption also raises serious safety and ethical concerns that must be carefully addressed before development fully proceeds. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents caused by human error and make transportation more accessible. However, taking human judgment out of driving may introduce new risks, particularly considering how imperfect and unpredictable real-world conditions can be.  

There is no question that driverless cars have the potential for benefits. Without human errors like distracted driving, drunk driving, or simple oversight, the article estimates that driverless cars could reduce up to 90% of traffic accidents. This would certainly save lives and healthcare costs. Autonomous vehicles may also allow those unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled, newfound mobility and independence. Being chauffeured at the push of a button could reshape how cities are designed and transform public transit.

However, development must still overcome major technological obstacles before driverless cars are ready for roads en masse. The article notes that sensors can be ""fooled"" and that software is not flawless. While continuing to improve, computers today still cannot perfectly identify every variable in traffic or respond appropriately to every unexpected scenario as a human driver can. Moreover, with humans now removed from the decision-making, unforeseen ethical questions emerge such as who or what would be at fault in an accident and how autonomous vehicles should prioritize safety when faced with split-second dilemmas. These issues require rigorous scrutiny and standardization. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars promise revolutionary changes, their development also brings risks that cannot be ignored. Considering the complex realities of driving and potential consequences of autonomous systems, it is prudent to take a cautious approach, thoroughly addressing technical and ethical concerns through extensive testing and standardization, before these vehicles are introduced without human supervision on public roads. Continued progress is worthwhile, but safely guided. Lives depend on getting driverless cars right.",1
"Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there are strong arguments calling for a shift towards election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College system ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As we saw in the 2000 election, a dispute over the popular vote can create significant unrest and uncertainty. In contrast, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of such disputes by awarding the winning candidate the necessary number of electoral votes to secure the presidency. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding prolonged legal battles and potential political instability.

Another essential aspect of the Electoral College is that it guarantees that the president is the choice of the entire nation, rather than just a few densely populated regions. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no region can dominate the election process. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on select areas and encourages them to campaign and address the concerns of voters across the entire country. As a result, the president elected through the Electoral College is seen as everyone's president, representing the interests of the entire nation.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the issues and concerns of diverse regions, rather than exclusively focusing on high-population areas. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced and comprehensive approach to governing that takes into account the needs of different states and regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College system offers a fair balance of power between large and small states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may give smaller states less influence in the national government, the Electoral College allows larger states to regain some weight in the political balance. This ensures that presidential candidates are not solely focused on areas with high populations but also engage with voters in less populous states. Such inclusivity is crucial in maintaining a representative democracy that values the voices of all its citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College provides a clear winner by awarding the presidency to the candidate with the majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting additional rounds of voting, ultimately ensuring a smooth and efficient electoral process.

While the arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system are compelling, it is crucial not to overlook the benefits that the Electoral College provides. By ensuring a certain outcome, representing the entire nation, focusing campaign efforts on swing states, balancing power between large and small states, and minimizing the need for runoff elections, the Electoral College upholds the principle of fairness and ensures the stability of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate all the benefits of the Electoral College system when making decisions that will impact our electoral process.

"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial and fair method of ensuring a balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election process.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a popular vote and electing the President by a vote in Congress. As outlined in The Office of the Federal Register's text, the process consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, as well as the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election, with the number of electors being directly proportional to the state's representation in Congress.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because a winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state also leads to a landslide electoral vote victory, giving a clear indication of the people's choice.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected, promoting a president who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Additionally, swing states play a significant role in the electoral process, attracting candidates to campaign and engage with voters in those states. This results in more thoughtful voters who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, consequently making an informed decision.

Another vital aspect is that the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution between large and small states. As Judge Posner indicates, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. This consideration for both large and small states is crucial for maintaining a fair and equal representation of all Americans in the electoral process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the potential complications associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may limit voter participation in states where a particular candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to emphasize that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences, as Judge Posner highlights. The continuation of the Electoral College recognizes the reality that no single vote will swing a national election and that voters participate to have their voices heard, regardless of the electoral outcome in their state.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains an essential system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a fair representation of all citizens, guarantees a clear and decisive outcome, and maintains balance between large and small states. While recognizing the need for improvements in our electoral process, I firmly believe that abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles on which it was established. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our current system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the benefits of the Electoral College and the potential consequences of abandoning it. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

Yours sincerely,

"Introduction:

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to explore a planet that is similar to Earth but yet, so different? Venus, the second planet from the sun, is a world that has captivated scientists for centuries. However, exploring Venus is not an easy task. In fact, it's a very dangerous pursuit. Despite the risks, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea using evidence from the article.

Body:

The author provides several reasons why studying Venus is important despite the dangers. Firstly, Venus is Earth's closest neighbor, and understanding its atmosphere and climate can help us better understand our own planet's climate change. The author states, ""Venus and Earth are similar in size and mass, and they have many other characteristics in common. Studying Venus can provide valuable insights into Earth's past, present, and future"" (para. 3). This is a compelling reason to explore Venus, as it can help us address one of the most pressing issues of our time - climate change.

Secondly, the author argues that exploring Venus can help us better understand the potential for life on other planets. Venus is believed to have once had liquid water on its surface, which raises the possibility that life may have existed there. The author notes, ""The possibility of life on Venus, even in the distant past, is a fascinating prospect that has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike"" (para. 5). By studying Venus, we can gain insights into the conditions necessary for life to exist on other planets, which can inform our search for extraterrestrial life.

Finally, the author emphasizes the technological advancements that will come from exploring Venus. The extreme conditions on Venus present significant challenges for scientists and engineers, but overcoming these challenges can lead to breakthroughs in areas such as materials science, robotics, and atmospheric science. The author states, ""The technological innovations that will arise from the challenge of exploring Venus will have far-reaching benefits for society"" (para. 7).

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. By exploring Venus, we can gain valuable insights into Earth's climate change, the potential for life on other planets, and technological advancements that can benefit society. While the risks of exploring Venus are real, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile endeavor. As the author notes, ""The challenge of exploring Venus is a daunting one, but it is a challenge that we must embrace"" (para. 8). I strongly agree with this statement and believe that the rewards of exploring Venus far outweigh the risks.",1
"The Face on Mars is a fascinating phenomenon that has intrigued people worldwide, with some even believing it was created by aliens. However, as a NASA scientist, I am here to convince you that the Face is just a natural landform. The evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" shows that the features on the Face are simply an illusion caused by lighting and shadows.

First of all, let's consider the fact that the Face on Mars has been photographed from different angles and under various lighting conditions. The article explains that the Face appears different in each photo, indicating that it is not a consistent and stable structure. If the Face were truly an alien creation, it should have a fixed and unchanging appearance regardless of the angle or lighting.

Furthermore, the article points out that the ""Face"" is not the only unusual feature on Mars. There are many other geological formations that resemble human-like faces or other familiar shapes. The odds of all of these formations being created by aliens are incredibly slim, and it is more likely that they are simply the result of natural erosion and weathering.

It is also worth noting that the article discusses the possibility of pareidolia, which is the human tendency to see faces or other recognizable patterns in random objects or shapes. This phenomenon can explain why so many people are convinced that the Face on Mars is evidence of extraterrestrial life.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars has captured the imaginations of many, but it is important to approach the phenomenon with a critical eye. The evidence presented in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" suggests that the features on the Face are merely a natural landform, and not the work of alien beings. By considering the facts and evidence, we can come to a more rational and informed conclusion.",1
"Introduction:
Hey there! I've heard you're convinced that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. While I understand why you might think that, I'm here to tell you that it's actually a natural landform. I've read the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and I'd like to share some evidence with you that supports my argument.

Body:
First of all, let's talk about the location of the Face. The article states that it's located in the Cydonia region of Mars, which is known for its unusual terrain. This includes the presence of mesas, which are flat-topped hills that can form in a variety of ways, including erosion and volcanic activity. The Face is actually a part of one of these mesas, and its shape can be explained by the natural geological processes that formed the area.

Another important point is that the Face isn't a perfect rectangle or square, as one might expect if it were created by intelligent beings. Instead, it's an irregular shape that's been eroded over time by wind and weather. The article mentions that the Face has been exposed to the harsh Martian environment for millions of years, which has caused it to deteriorate and lose its original shape.

Furthermore, the article mentions that the Face is made up of a type of rock called dolomite, which is common on Mars. This suggests that the Face is not a structure built by aliens, but rather a natural formation made up of the same materials as the surrounding terrain.

Finally, the article states that the Face is not unique on Mars. There are other similar formations on the planet, including one called the ""Tholus,"" which is also a natural landform. This suggests that the Face is not a one-of-a-kind structure created by aliens, but rather one of many natural formations that can be found on Mars.

Conclusion:
So there you have it! While it's understandable to be fascinated by the idea of alien life on Mars, the evidence suggests that the Face is simply a natural landform. Its location, shape, composition, and similarity to other formations on the planet all support this conclusion. I hope this information has been helpful in convincing you that the Face on Mars is not a creation of intelligent beings, but rather a fascinating example of the natural wonders that can be found on our neighboring planet.",1
"Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to you today to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is crucial in maintaining the stability and legitimacy of the presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes unity and trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requires candidates to campaign and appeal to voters in various regions across the country. Ensuring that candidates have broad support across the nation helps to prevent the development of presidents with only regional appeal. It also ensures that all Americans can feel represented and that the new president will have regard for their interests.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This gives more weight to the votes of citizens living in these states and encourages political participation and informed decision-making. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and priorities of a diverse range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores some balance to political representation by providing additional weight to large states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states more representation than their population would suggest. The Electoral College helps to address this imbalance by allocating more attention from presidential candidates to larger states. This ensures that the concerns and needs of voters in larger states are not overshadowed by those in smaller states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This has the potential to complicate the presidential election process and prolong the uncertainty surrounding the outcome. By using the Electoral College, a clear winner is determined, reducing the need for additional elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, these arguments do not hold up when considering the practical benefits it provides. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal and unity, encourages participation in swing states, gives attention to large states, and avoids run-off elections. These factors contribute to the stability, representativeness, and legitimacy of the presidency.

In conclusion, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College has proven to be an effective system that balances the interests of all American citizens and maintains political stability. Thank you for considering my perspective.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in suburban areas can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This growing trend of car-free communities and car-reduced lifestyles can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more accessible and sustainable communities.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting a low-car suburban lifestyle, like in the German community of Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, individuals can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. This helps in the fight against climate change and the preservation of the environment.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris implemented a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have immediate positive effects on air pollution levels. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, car-free communities like Vauban and car-free days like the one in Bogota can help improve air quality and create healthier environments for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier lifestyles. In car-free communities, where walking and cycling are the primary means of transportation, residents are more physically active. This leads to improved health outcomes such as reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and sedentary lifestyle-related conditions. By prioritizing pedestrian-friendly spaces and infrastructure, these communities create opportunities for residents to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to healthier and more active lives.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By adopting a smart planning approach, which includes placing stores along walkable main streets instead of distant malls, communities can become more compact and easily accessible via public transportation. This reduces the need for extensive parking spaces and makes daily activities more convenient for residents. It also promotes a sense of community by creating shared spaces and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, encouraging social interactions and connection among residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers a myriad of advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and creating sustainable and accessible communities, the benefits of embracing car-free lifestyles are significant. As we continue to witness a shift in American behavior with fewer cars being bought and less driving occurring, it is important to recognize and support initiatives that limit car usage for the betterment of individuals and the environment.",1

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of maintaining this system rather than switching to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing the information provided in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner, dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all method most states employ creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, thus minimizing the chances of an inconclusive outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation and prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning particular regions. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to mobilize support in densely populated areas, such as major cities, and could afford to overlook the concerns and interests of less populated regions. The requirement for a candidate to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different states ensures that they consider the needs of the nation as a whole.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. Swing states have the potential to decide the outcome of an election, leading candidates to campaign heavily in these states and provide more information and attention to their voters. This not only increases voter engagement but also allows for a more thoughtful selection of the president by swing state voters who are likely to be well-informed about the candidates and their policies.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores a balance for large states in the political process. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states have fewer seats relative to their populations. The Electoral College grants larger states with more electoral votes, thus giving them more influence in the election process compared to smaller states. This ensures that their issues and concerns are adequately addressed by presidential candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, which may complicate the election process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This prevents the necessity for additional rounds of voting and guarantees a decisive result.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as its potential to discourage voters in states where a particular party is unlikely to win, it is important to note that this has not significantly impacted voter turnout in presidential elections. The majority of individuals who vote in the United States do so to express their political preference rather than with the expectation that their vote will solely determine the outcome of the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, as a compromise between a vote in Congress and a popular vote, plays a crucial role in our democratic process. It ensures certainty in outcomes, encourages candidates to address the needs of the entire nation, gives due attention to swing states, grants larger states a fair share of influence, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will consider my perspectives and continue to support what I believe is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is supported by evidence from various sources, including the excerpts from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, especially in suburban areas where car ownership is high, we can significantly contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. Vauban, a German suburb mentioned in Rosenthal's article, is a perfect example of how living without cars can lead to a reduction in emissions. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The excerpt from Duffer's article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impacts of car emissions on air pollution. When a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent, and the smog cleared enough to rescind the ban for certain days. Similar effects were seen in Bogota, Colombia, during their car-free day, as mentioned in a passage by Selsky. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly improve air quality in congested cities, benefitting the health and well-being of citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient transportation systems. By focusing on smart planning and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create more compact and accessible communities. This is evident in the example of Vauban, where stores are placed within walkable distances and public transportation serves as the main mode of transportation. By reducing car usage, we can minimize traffic congestion, shorten commute times, and make cities more livable for all residents.

There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. The reduction in car ownership can lead to savings for individuals who no longer need to purchase and maintain cars. As mentioned in Rosenthal's article, some suburbs in the United States are promoting ""car-reduced"" communities, and experts expect public transport to play a larger role in federal transportation bills. By investing in public transportation and creating car-free or low-car communities, we can redirect funds from building and maintaining highways to more sustainable forms of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more efficient transportation systems and providing economic benefits, there are numerous reasons to consider reducing our reliance on cars. By making changes at both individual and societal levels, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While changing to a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, I believe the Electoral College protects the interests of small states and encourages candidates to build broader coalitions.

One argument made in favor of a popular vote is that it would make every citizen's vote truly equal. However, opponents rightly point out that without the Electoral College, candidates would focus only on winning major population centers, ignoring the needs of rural areas and smaller states. The current system encourages candidates to consider a wider range of viewpoints and campaign across many different states. It prevents a few heavily populated coastal states from dominating national elections.

Those in favor of a popular vote system claim it would increase voter turnout. However, others argue turnout could actually decrease as voters in non-competitive states feel their votes do not really matter. The Electoral College gives incentive for Get-Out-the-Vote efforts and local campaigning in more states than just a handful of swing areas. It makes elections more representative nationwide rather than just a battle in a few select regions.  

While no system is perfect, on balance the Electoral College protects the interests of smaller states and encourages presidential candidates to build broader geographically diverse coalitions. Rather than eliminate it entirely, potential reforms like ratifying the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could be a compromise worth exploring. However, I do not believe wholly dismantling the current system in favor of a popular vote is the best approach. Thank you for considering my views on this important issue.

Sincerely,

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from International Experiments

Reducing car usage has considerable implications for our society, environment, and personal well-being. It promotes more sustainable urban development, decreases pollution, and contributes to healthier lifestyles. Insights from global examples like Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Columbia; and shifts in the American car culture illuminate the myriad benefits of limiting car usage.

Vauban, Germany sets the stage with its pioneering suburb that has heavily limited car usage. With 70% of families not owning cars, Vauban's initiative reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly contributed by cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Such car-free environments are also considered conducive to less stressful, more community-oriented lifestyles, as noted by Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

In Paris, the reduction in car usage led to a significant decrease in smog and pollution. The partial driving ban led to a 60% reduction in congestion and an improvement in the city's air quality, affirming the positive environmental impact of limiting car usage (Duffer). Similarly, the ""Day Without Cars"" event in Bogota, Columbia, aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Its success lays testament to the effectiveness of this approach in large urban communities (Selsky).

In the United States, a shift is occurring where Americans are buying fewer cars and increasingly opting for alternatives like public transportation or biking. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also aligns with changing social and demographic trends. As Michael Sivak, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, notes, this could indicate a fundamental shift in transportation and mobility trends (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

However, reducing car usage is not merely about improving the environment. It reshapes urban spaces to be more accessible, compact, and community-centered, especially in suburbs where car usage is traditionally high (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Additionally, it opens opportunities for innovative mobility solutions, as illustrated by Bill Ford’s business plan, focusing on a connected network of diverse transportation modes (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

In contrast to the previous car-dominated culture, there is a growing trend towards creating sustainable, transit-oriented communities where car usage is limited. This shift represents a move towards a healthier, more sustainable, and community-oriented future. It is essential for fellow citizens to understand the advantages of limiting car usage, and take steps towards embracing this new model of mobility and urban living. By doing so, we can contribute positively to reducing our environmental impact, improving societal well-being, and paving the way for a more sustainable future.",1
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide both benefits and disadvantages. On one hand, this technology may help teachers identify when students are feeling confused, frustrated, or bored during lessons in order to adjust their teaching approach accordingly. By recognizing these emotions in real-time, teachers could work to engage students more effectively and ensure their educational needs are being met. The technology could also be useful for assessing students' overall emotional well-being and development, which impacts their ability to learn. 

However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions via this technology may infringe on their privacy and be considered intrusive. Students should feel comfortable freely expressing a range of natural emotions in the learning environment without being watched and labeled by computers. There are also uncertainties around how accurate these systems are at interpreting complex human emotions from facial cues alone. Subtle expressions could be misread, leading teachers to make incorrect assumptions about how students are feeling. Relying too heavily on this technology may undermine the important role of interpersonal communication between teachers and students.

Overall, while FACS technology shows potential to provide teachers with insights that could support student learning, its drawbacks related to privacy, intrusiveness, and lack of nuance also need to be seriously considered. If used judiciously as a supplemental tool rather than as a replacement for teacher observation and interaction with students, it may have value. But more research is required to determine whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of constant facial expression monitoring in the classroom. Both the practical applications and ethical implications would require careful oversight and consideration of student well-being.",1
