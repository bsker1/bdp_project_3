"In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus author talks about how studying Venus is worth the trouble. One reason the auther might think this is because Venus is so much like earth it was even nicknaned Earths twin.

People belive that Venus is like earth because they are close to the same sice and they are close toghther in our solar system. The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" also the author states that ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The author talks abou how NASA has a plan for humans to study Venus. She says that thay will build something that will alow them to float above the surface so they dont have to be on the surface of Venus. Even tho they wount be able to completely explore Venus thay will be closer than ever. This is why the author belives Venus is worth studying and how NASA planns to do it

The aouthor makes very good points on why she thinks we should study Venus. Even tho Venus is the second planet from the sun which means its one of the hottest, it is the most like earth. ""Today it still has some fetures like earth."" The fact that Venus is so much likeb earth is one reason to study the planet.",0
"Car alarms, car horns, and engines are basically the only thing people hear nowadays. The number of cars in the streets are simply begining to get out of hand.

Citizens all around the world, we all should really try to limit the amount of time that we are spending using our vehicals.

If you really take a moment to think about it, this could honestly turn out to be a really good thing.

Cars are not neccisarily a need, they are a want. I can undertand if you are going to be traveling a far distance that two feet cant get you, but certianlty and ten minute walk to the grocery store/market cant hurt.

Limiting car usage is very important. Most families tend to spend about about $20-50.00 on gas a week. One advantage to limiting car usuage is saving a ton of money on gas that could easily be spent of food, to feed your family.

"" ""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" "" People who have decided to limit the amount of time they spent using their car, are much happier.

One advantage to limiting the use of cars is that the air would become much more fresh and clean, and it would become alot more healtheir for us citizens.

"" ""

Its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said a busiinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seated bicycle with his wife."" ""

Most people that have decided to stop using cars or have significantly limited their car usuage, have nothing but positive things to say.

If more people became aware that not spending so much time driving was a good thing, and simply limited their care usuage, the air would become so much more clean, and alot more of us would be happy.

A former citizen has shared with us that one advantage to limiting car usgae for her is that her children have

""... organized their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car pool with friends."" She has also mentioned that her children were not in any rush to get their drivers license, even though where they live a car would would definetly ""...come in handy."" Most people have really been able to enjoy walking and not using their cars.

Driving your car is not intirely a bad thing, but simply limiting your car usage is a wonderfull thing, and many advantages come to limitng car usuage. You save a great deal of money on gas when you decide to walk rather than to drive, the air become a lot more clean and heathy for our lungs, and many people are able to focus more on the important things in life, like jobs and friends and family.

If you decide to park your car in the garage and put away the keys, you'd really be able to see how nice it is to just walk to your destination rather than drive, it's a great way to realx and to just enjoy yourself.",0
"I do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why i think we should no have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be conicered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could died. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or eldery people. In the article its says ""If the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufactuer?"". How will the law handle situtations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.

I do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. There are also, some good reason why we could have them. A couple reason are they dont use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. i think that there should not be driverless cars, and cars should say how they are.",0
"The era of mass car usage is slowly coming to an end. Many countries around the world are implementing innovative methods of limiting car usage in their country. Although a car may seem like the logical and easier way for one to get around, there are many other less costly, and better for the environment methods of transportation. It is crucial to the future of the environment for the world to act now and use less cars. Cars produce emissions that are very bad for the ozone. If the ozone tears, radiation from the sun will penetrate the atmosphere and severely damage the earth in which so many life forces thrive. There are countless advantages of limiting car usage that would benefit all the world in the longhaul.

New communities are rising all over the globe where car usage is severely limited and all residents are pedestrians. It may seem like a dysfunctional community but the residents actually feel to the contrary. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" without the use of cars, residents and their families feel much more content. All the resources they need are within the community and definently within walking or biking distance. This is just one of many progressive ideas that has proved successful and very beneficial.

In other cities where pollution is very high, bans on car usage are coming into place very well. Citizens are discouraged by law to operate personal forms of transportation on certain days. This came into place in Paris after the whole city was drowned in smog. Smog is the pollution exerted from cars and mixed with fog. Although some people did break the law to use their car, it worked for the most part. Many people do not realize the the effect pollution has on the environment until they are able to see physical change. That is why the world must act now before physical change can be seen globaly.

Change needs to happen now. Many communities are begining to see the effects of their cares and are using them less. Cars are a trend that is slowly decreasing. maybe one day, there will be no harmful car usage. Maybe one day. Change is a' comin.",0
"There are parks place were you need ot pay and other parks places are for free. Let's says that rich residents you need to pay and it will cost more money. In germany there are steets completely car-free and who pay a parking places for who know how much money,that are only who are rich they will do it. Result ,70 percent of vauban families do not own a cars ,and 57 percent sold there cars. who will do that just there car something isn't worlthy and peolpe should think twoas what are they doing. If they don't have a car they should to a transport or someone could take you. That will be less money that you are spending and think about the environmental. Peolpe should think to pay there license plate first or the police will get you. maybe the police could take your car away unitl you need to pay and if you are drinking that could be a problem for you. Drinkig and drive is the wose idea that you ever have or texting to. Using biked,skated or riding a bus isn't that bad at all for some poelpe think that. Those things are for car-free because you don't need to pay at and you are having fu n out in the streets then other peolpe out there in the world. That could save the environment from the gas that come from your car and the smoke that come your car that effect it. Those things will change your life to live and having fun with your family. President Obama want's the united state greenhouse gas emission,unveiled last week,will get a fortuious assist from an incipent shift in american behavior. In the united state  we need to change with the cars and having a car is more respesilitly than your family. In april 3013,the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and who know how much percent peolpe that don't have car.

"There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.

This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such ""aliens"".

Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the ""case"" was never thoroughly thought through.

There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts. There is still research going on about what's casuing these strange formations, but you can be sure that it's not the work of aliens.",0
"In the past, if society was told that cars would be able to drive themselves people would have called you crazy or would have laughed it off,calling it wishful thinking. Throughout life, we as humans have worked towards new advances in technology. We are always looking for a way to make life easier and simpler. The queastion is where so we draw the line. Saftey. Saftey has been a concern through time because we are less independent and have become more dependent on machines that could easily break, causes permanant damage. With this in mind, it is not safe to have drivless cars.

Having driverless cars could be harmful to not only to the passenger, but other drivers as well. The text states, ""In reality, Google has had cars that could drive independetly under specific conditions since 2009."" If this is the case, why are they just coming out with it. It is probably due to the fact that there are casualties. For example, the passage mentions that they have not fully developed the driverless car to handle complicated traffic issues, which is basically what driving requires. This could definatly result in drivers getting injured. Not only could they cause injures, but they could also cause legal issues.

If one thinks about it, most people don't want to rely on a car's driving if there is a chance it could cause an accident. There are no laws about driverless cars so it could be caos if something goes wrong. What if the car causes an accident because of an malfunction? There is no law about driverless cars, which means it could be blamed on the driver or the manufacturer. These are very concerning points that has to be taken in to consideration. Some may argue that driverless cars are better than human drivers.

Although there are numerous drawbacks to driverless cars, some may say they are better drivers than humans. The passage states,"" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This shows that driverless cars opperate breaks better than humans do.

Although driverless cars are good with brakes, thay can't be relied on enough to put ones life in their hands. The passage states,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This means that even though the point of driverless cars is that humans don't have to drive, we technically still have to drive and stay alert. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of creating driverless cars if it is not actually driverless. Even though we rely on technoloy for various activities, that doesn't mean we have to rely on them to do everything.

The reality is that driverless cars are more trouble than good. They compromise the saftey of people on the road. They also don't have any regulations or laws, which could impact driving and saftey. When taking into account that there are no laws or order for driverless cars, it is no question that driverless cars should not be sold to society. We,as humans, have a responsibiliy to protect and mantain the saftey and life God gave us.",0
"""I'm much happier this way,"" What caused someone to say this? Simply no longer owning a car! Based on how car dependant mostly everyone's life is and how badly most people that don't have a car want one you'd think that going from having one to lacking one must be terrible. Well statistically speaking we might all be moving towards this idea and it might not be such a bad thing!

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Vauban, Germany is home to people that have chosen to give life without cars a shot, many of which love the life style. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car just to go there. Although this has mostly only been done here many have started slowly adopting the idea. As the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, of this article pointed out passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe, and in more car populated areas such as the United States up to 50%. Robert Duffer stated in Paris bans driving due to smog that in Paris Driving had been limited by their government due to extreme levels of pollution and after a short amount of time the ban was called off because the smogpollution had lowered. Just one of the advantages of limiting the usage of cars would be cutting down these huge numbers and getting rid of these issues, and if you asked anyone im pretty sure they'd say that this one advantage is plenty reason already to look into this. Imagine how drastically improved the planet would be if others adopted what Vauban is already doing!

Want a holiday to promote the limiting of cars? Well there actually is one in Bogota, Colombia! Millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to places like work on this day. It already has three years running so far, even if its raining that day, the mayor claims that it doesnt stop people from participating. This day is starting to also branch out to other colombian cities such as Cali and Valledupar, imagine if eventually it becomes an international holiday, the advantages are everywhere. Due to the limiting of car usage there are more people walking on the sidewalks and this has caused the government to improve those sidewalks by making new smooth ones and getting rid of the old cracked ones. More restaurants, parks, sports centers, and even entire shopping centers have been built and opened to the people walking which is a life style improving advantage. If the limiting of cars is done in more places then new things to do and try will open up in that area and in turn prove to be a great advantage from limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has writen about the possibility that in the United States the peak of driving has been reached. As it turns out Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less miles on average, and getting fewer licenses every year that goes by. If such a large population such as the United States is cooling down on car usage why not speed that process up and governments start slowly but efficiently reducing car usage internationally? This would mean that in public transport there would be more socializing because the people that take that same bus everyday at 7:00 AM along with you would become your friends or at least aquaintances. So when you think about it friendships might even come with car limiting as well!

From the reduction of polution to the improvements of everyday life style to even possibly socializing with new people, the possibilities of car usage limiting are endless.",0
"Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask. So why they ""MGS"" claims is not a face? We don't,be we do know is that a high-resolution images and 3D altimetry takes picture from outer space.

"Dear State Senator,

As A citizen in the United States i say that keeping the electoral college is a good idea!

Taking away the electoral college would make alot of people angry. Having an electoral college makes it ten times easier for the government. Having an electoral college makes it more fair for citizens and having the majority people agree, alot its alot easier for the governement to see who the people want to lead us and lastly there will be alot less arguments from citizens because if they dont agree they cant do anything about it because majority rules.

Having an electoral college makes it alot more fair for citizens to vote. The electoral college is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president. Choosing a president and voting for him/her make sthe citizens agree. When it comes down to voting day the citizens have to come to a majority to rule. Having the votes sent to congress and them deciding is very fair because they can decide the final dicison for the citizena dn who tehy think the citizens want more.

The electoral college has 538 electors, so its not like 2 people can decide the president. Having an elecotral college makes it alot easier to decide for the government. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. One for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for you senators. The presidential election is held every 4 years so people have time to decide if they want to re elect or to keep the current president.

Electoral elections have less argument between the citizens. If you took electoral college away people would be starting riots about who to choose. Having this system is very organized and prepared, if you just take away and start something new its going to be a mess. Electoral college is a very mature way in electing president. Citizens dont have to argue because the majority rules all so they cant fight someone because they didnt pick who they wanted

THose are the reasons on why they should not take away electoral college!!It makes it more fair! its makes it easier to decide! Lastely its less arguments with citizens about who won! So as a citizen in the U.S. i say do not take electoral college away!",0
"Should Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) be used to read student's emotions?

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

Some elementery schools have laptops for every student, which makes it easyer than ever for a teacher to make and publish an assinment.

As I personly wittnesed my siblings having homework over the weekend, and Fridays, both of which, I never had in elementer school.

To sum it all up, the more tecnolagy we have dosn't always mean it needs to be implamented in a classroom, just becase we can dosen't mean we should.

Not to mention, who will pay for such a system, our tax dollors?",0
"It would be good to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it would be a great opportunity to help out, a lot of chances to go sight-seeinng, and would open up a world of awareness.

Firstly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program would give you the chance to help out. Many countries were left in ruins after World War 2, this program helps though. The Seagoing Cowboys program hires ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals. What better way could you help out.

Participating gives out huge amounts of help that is put to good use.

Second of all, there are lots of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke Bomberger explains, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" Luke, like many others, got plenty of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke went from Europe to China to Greece and even Venice, there are so many places to visit, joining would be the best way to see them.

To add to that, participating would open up a great world of awareness. Joining helps bring about an awareness to people of other countries and their needs. Joining would not only be an amazing adventure, it would help with seeing other peoples point of views and how they need help.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is helpful and fun all in one, and would be the best choice to make. It may have it's downsides, but the good parts in joning, (helping out, sight-seeing, and awareness) make up for any and all bad parts.",0
"Dear state senator,

I feel as though the electoral college is unfair and irrational. It has messed up so many things in the past as well as the present. The presidential elections would be more truthful about who should win compared to the system of voting we have now. This voting system is untruthful, bias, not fair to everyone else that votes as well. If the entire United States were to vote, the votes would be more honest and real. In my opinion, it is almost crucial to hear what your people have to say about the country they live in, therefore it is important to know who we want as our president.

Because we have people of a higher authority standing in for us and voting for the president, it becomes untruthful. Some of these people just vote for whom ever they want, and when something this big is just thrown out the window like that, it is the deciding factor between a good\bad leader of our country; or even whether or not the best president was chosen. But those votes that are just voted at random to say that they did their part in the election are not honest votes. These people with higher authority dont care who wins,[some of them anyway], and that his hurting the human population in the U.S..

Not only is it untruthful, it develops to be bias as well. People tend to use their personal feelings fro someone as an advantage or even disadvantage. When someone does not like a person, they can not look passed that, and during an election as big as this one, you have to be able to look passed the fact that you may dislike them and ask yourself: ""Would this person be a good, strong leader and role model for our country?"". Same way goes if you like someone, it is not right to vote for someone just because you think they are a good person, there are far more factors needed when running a country. You should ask yourself the same question: ""Would this person be a good, strong leader and role model for our country?"".

The people of the U.S. would most definitly like to have a say in who runs their country, but with the electortal college, they can not do so. The people with higher authority such as the present president, and the senators, etc. should want to hear what their people have to say, as well as use it and put it into perspective. We should decide who runs the country we live in, not just people of ""higher rank"". Please put this into perspective and help us do something about it.",0
"Scientists shouldn't travel to Venus anytime soon. Why would you say that you may ask there are a few reasons why scientist shouldn't travel to Venus. Venus isn't a safe place to travel to. It's already a risk traveling in space, but it's an even bigger risk to travel to Venus. Here are some of the reasons why Venus isn't safe.

First the unimaginable heat on Venus can make metal boil in a snap. According to the text "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". The average summertime day on Earth ranges from 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit those are temperatures some people can barely stand. Imagine 8 times 100 degrees that sure is toasty. No human can last 1 second on Venus without protection, and without being burnt to a crisp.

Next the atmosphere is mostly made of carbon. According to the text ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". These are poor conditions to live under especially since humans can't live without oxygen. The carbon is also poisonous to humans as well in order to breath on this planet you'd need a huge oxygen tank. Not to mention there's also sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

Finally just like Earth Venus has natural disasters as well. The text states "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". Unlike Earth these conditions are amplified on Venus, and are stronger on Venus than on Earth. any evidence scientists do get from probes is electrical shock. Imagine what would happen to any ship we send with human in it ""KAPOW"" lightning strikes.

It's safe to say Venus isn't human friendly. Venus isn't human friendly because of the; boiling heat, the carbon dioxide, and the intense natural disasters.

Venus doesn't seem robot friendly either due to when a probe gets close it'll stike the probe with lightning. As if these are warning signs Venus clearly doesn't want any visitors anytime soon it's best to stay on Earth for now. Venus is uninhabitable for now at least you'll never know what the future may bring.",0
"Many people think that aliens are real, but they're not! Many people believe that this photo is caused by aliens. They don't know the true story of this and that it has to be caused by natural landform. There's no proof that aliens are real and no one really proved it at all! People just assume that it's caused by aliens because they see a big hole, but it's natural landform. Until I see proof that aliens are real then I will believe them, but right now there is no proof at all.

Many people think that it's caused by aliens, but it's not. It even said, ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation."" It may look like a face, but that's just how it is. Conspiracy theorists don't even know what they're talking about. They just assume things, but they never show proof. NASA even showed proof that it's not caused by alien, but it may look like it was caused by aliens. It's just a natural landform.

Many people waited to see if the natural landform was actually caused by aliens. JPL revealed that it was a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. Many people still believe that it's caused by aliens and people even showed proof that it's not caused by aliens. Not everyone was satisfied that it was a natural landform because, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" There really hasn't been a single one proof that aliens actually exist.

Although, the natural landform does look like an alien, but that's just how the natural landform is. The picture was actually showing us a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. So, this is common here, in the Earth, so this has to be common in Mars. They even said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, it was provened to be a mesa.

Many people thought that this picture was to be an alien. Many people, including NASA, even showed proof that it wasn't an alien. NASA at first did think that it was an alien, until they showed us proof of what they researched. People even showed us proof that it was just mesa, which is common to happen. It may look like it was caused by an alien, but it was just a natural landform that looks like an alien.",0
"Although we rely on cars as a primary means of transportation for our busy lives there are many advantages to not using as much or even having them at all. Now driving in a car is very useful. It gets us where we want to go much faster than just biking or walking there. But there are many benefits and advantages to a world without cars. One advantage is that there will be less polution in the world. Another is that people will be just a little less lazy. And even more is that the world may be just a little quieter and safer with the lack of cars.

Thousands and thousands of people today are either driving a car or some other motorized means of transportation. And though yes they do provide a fasts way to get around, they give off so much exhaust into our relatively clean air and pollute it that its almost toxic to breathe in some places. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it says that ""After days or nearrecord polution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars polluted the air so badly that in some places people completly banned them all together just to rid their air of the filth that the cars had created.

Many people in the world today have gotten lazier and cars have helped them get this way. Rather than ride a bike to their destination or even walk people decide to be lazy. They drive their car there or take a bus or taxi. But if people have to get up and walk to their destination rather than just walk to their cars it will make the world just a little bit better of a place to live. There may even be less stress in the world. No waiting in traffic and no yelling at others when they cut you off or drive too slow. The only problem or stress you may have to worry about is the crowd of people you may be walking with.

Now yet another advantage to a life without cars is that it will be quieter and safer. There won't be any honking of horns in your ears. There will not be any more roars of engines. No more yelling at other drivers for their ""lack of skill"" at driving. The world will be safer as well. No more people getting hit by cars while walking and no more car accidents. No more police car chases that put innocent civilians in danger of getting hit.

There are many advantages in life with no cars. A world without cars is less polluted. A world without cars is less stressfull. and it makes the world quieter and much safer. Cars are a basic part of life and we have grown used to them but the world may be a little better if they were no longer here.",0
"The author of this passage talks about exploring Venus, we all know its not a safe thing to do, the author knows that as well. It has been more than three decades since a spacecraft has landed on Venus, so this author wants to change that and land a spacecraft on Venus as soon as possibe.

On a personal note, I strongly believe that if I were to get a piece of paper and make a poll saying, ""Do you think landing on venus is a good idea? Yes or No"". I wouldn't be suprised if more people voted ""No"" than ""Yes"". You really have to look at it safety wise. You're putting yourself in danger by landing on the cloudiest planet in our solar system. You're landing on an 800 degree Fahrenheit planet. I get it, three decades is a long time and they want to change that and fly a person, or multiple people to Venus. But for safety purposes, i'd rather wait it out for another few decades.

In conclusion I think that they support this idea very well. The author gives a lot of information about Venus and the risks of going there.",0
"I want to change the election by popular votes instead of the Electoral College because even if the president gets popular votes, it wouldn't matter anyway. They will have to vote the president by using the Electoral College. It wouldn't be fair because ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" That means if the president gets the most popular votes, it won't matter.

Back then, presidents wouldn't accept the Electoral College. ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" They all thought that it wouldn't be fair if the popular votes wouldn't count and the Electoral College has its defenders. The thing that's wrong with the Electoral College is because ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So if someone were to vote for a president, they would be voting for a slate of the 34 Democratic electors. After that, they pledged it on the president that they voted for.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" It's because of the winner-take-all system that happens also on each state. So candidates think they know they aren't going to win and never spend time on other states as well. People also think that the Electoral College is unfair because they never get to see the candidates and they won't know who they're going to vote. People only relied on Bob Dole. His goal was to ""Abolish the electoral college!""

When people also vote for a presdential canidate they actually vote for the slate of electors. Which was why Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet he had fewer electoral votes. But there is one way to settle a dispute of the outcome of an Electoral College vote. ""it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The Electoral College also has a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal but has enough electoral votes to vote for president.

So now we all know how the Electoral College is unfair. Because of the constant votes that don't matter at all yet they always make sure to vote that president and all of the popular votes wouldn't matter. That's why I want to change to popular votes than the Electoral College does. All we need to do is work together to over come the Electoral College so the votes can be fair and we would want to vote for the president that we want.",0
"Think about when you were just about to turn 16 you were so exited. You would finally be abel to drive and have freedom. Well if we make cars that drive them selfs that could be gone and many other great things. I think this is a bad idea. Having cars that drive them selfs could be dangerous too it says in the passage that they are driver assisted and that a person still has to be in the car just in case they need to take over. Well if i get tried and im not driving and I fall asleep what happens whe the car needs mecto drive ? ""Manufactures are also consedering using cameras to watch that the drivers are remaining focused on the road."" Well ok but what about my privacy? Think about when you were young and would go to a secret spot with your boyfreind or girlfreind, what if that camrea recored that or someone hacked into the camrea and watched. If a crash happens how would ypu determine if it was the cars fault or yours? There is so many more problems with having cars that drive themselfs. I dont think we should have cars that drive them selfs too much fun is lost and new challenges with laws will occer.",0
"The face on Mars is just a natural landform because it states in the text that the only reason the rock looks like a face is because it has shadows from the sun, and in this case the shadows give the ""face"" eyes, mouth, and a nose.

Yes even though there have sightings of UFO's or ( Unidentified Flying Object) the conspiracy theorists say that this face is an alien artifact but it states that the only reason why they say it is a feace is so more people are attracted to Mars.

The landform int a real face because if you compare the ""face"" to an Earth rock in that shape they would look the same, until you add some light from the sun causing shadows, and it would include the facial parts of any human man or woman.

As you see from paragraph 3 you will see that it states in the last sentence "" The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Although, it did the scientist thought that tehy have accomplished something huge by tricking people into thinking it was a huge head.

In my conclusion, these are the reasones that the natural landform is not a face.",0
"the electoral college is pretty bad. you should make the vote go by poplar demand instead of electoral college. one reason is because many people diont understand how it works thus more inclinded not to vote.

everyday pelple want to know whats going on in their government and you erase the fact and make them think the electoral college is the answer. you have to go back to making popluar vote a thing, trust brhu. once in a while ytheir are times when popluar vote wins but electoral loses, this is bad becuase many people like it more but only a few electors  care about really voting. whkle everyone really wants to win others dont reqally know. so mr presidnet make it so that people can vote betteryou nederrd to not respond to my letter just know that u read it. if u make po;luar vote better more popel would use iyt thus making the countrty an  better place. you alsol need tol think of all the familys that need to understadn what the electoral college is. it is a much harder and complex method thna popluar vote.

another reaspon is the complexity of the big states vs. small states. when they are bigger and they have lees things than when they are bigger. if ou have that cponundrum it makes it very hard. man this essay is getting hard to type. i really want to sleep/. but thats what people who wouldd be voting =for the electoral college would say. they need to be much more carefluol in the way the orgaize their thinking and the way that they controilmathe ranking of stsate vs popluation vs electorla college for these reasons here i think that we should make the elcetorla collger iilleagla and punishable by death. we should switch the the polpuar vote . it would be muich betetr to make it that way and people will eb much more inclined to vote.",0
"On May 24, 1976, NASA's Viking one spacecraft was circling mars. It took many photos of landing sites for its sister ship Viking two. As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.

Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.

Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.

On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.

This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject. Conspiracy theorists are not always wrong but in this case they are.",0
"Technologies nowadays can recognize emotions. The software makes out the 44 main muscles on your face in order to identify what you are feeling. They base it off of the 6 basic emotions. Technology now is so innovative that now we may be able to use this in classrooms to tell whether or not to change a subject or not when a teacher is teaching.

So all of this begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 of the major muscles in your face. In the model all these muscles move like a actual humans. Dr. Paul Echman ,creator of the FACS, classified the face having 6 basic emotions- happiness ,surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness. Each thing is accosciated with its own characteristic movement. Each and every single person has the same universal emotions on there face, they are all universal. Dr. Huang said that "" even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" The real question is tho is how this can help us when it comes to school and teachings in the classroom. What I mean by this is that teachers could know when the students are not finding interest in a subject of a disscussion anymore. This technology can scan the room and see what peoples emotions are during the subject and if they are not good then the teacher could try a different approach and if that worked then they would know that is what they need to try for the next class. Everyone learns a certain way and if you have a class that has a majority of people that learn a certain way then you know the sense of direction you need to teach based on this technology.

Now that we know that everyones emotions come off the same way and that everyones reactions to things are relativly close, don't you think that this would be good in a learning enviroment? Every person learns a certain way and if you know this then why dont we use this technology in classes so the teachers know that they need to change up teaching styles or just come back to something a different way.",0
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, It's really fun, theres lots of games to play, and t you can make friends, also that you can see diffrent countrys!

The first reason you should join the program is that it's a once in a life time opportunity. Just like Luke said, because if you got asked if you wanted to join and you said no chances are that their not going to ask you again. Manly because there not going go spend a long time looking for you to ask you again. Luke took the opportunity as soon as his best friend asked him.

Another reason you should join the program is that it'll be really fun. You'll be able to make freinds and hang out with them when your not busy. Luke, more than likely, made a ton of friends.

The third reason you should join the program is that theres fun games to play! After everyone is done doing what there suppose to and theres nothing left to do you can play games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Luke loved playing these games!

The last reason you should join the prgram is that you can go and see a lot of diffrent countrys, if your lucky enough. Such as China, Acropolis which is in Greece, and Europe. You might even be able to sail the Atlantic ocean, just like Luke did.

So you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program so you can do all of these cool stuff like making friend, seeing Europe, And China. You never know this program could open the world to you, just like it did to Luke! All of these thing Luke did don't you want to do these things to?",0
"If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors. There are somethings wrong with the electoral college like , american people dont consider themselves lucky with any election that happens. Americans are not grateful cause they might not have wanted the same president or wanted different electors. If you wanted to be president and you had good electors people all over the world would vote for you just because the electors you got. Americans vote for you to get the electors , i believe that is not good for our state because the electors of the president can switch the statements of one another. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The electoral is Abolish !

in 1968 , a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election. In 1976, there would be a tie of 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii . At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair ! The electoral is Abolish !",0

"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is writes mostly in favor of driverless cars but adds some valid points as to why these cars may not be the best decision. I believe that the latter opinion is the logical stance. If completely driverless cars were to exsist in the furture the human race would lose one more skill due to technology. On top of this loss of skill there runs the risk of computer malfuntion within the car, legal issues if and when these cars get into an accident, and people attempting to hack the cars' computer system in an attempt to kill someone.

If these are created into exsistence then people will no longer posses the abilily to drive their own car. While this may seem like a good thing these cars will not be able to do everything a human typically can do in avoiding an accident. When a situation occurs that there may be an accident there may be an opportunity for the ""driver"" to take over. Unfortunatly, this will be pointless because these ""drivers"" will no longer know how to control their own cars.

Furthermore, if and when this accident happens, who will take the blame for its cause. Will it be the drivers fault, the car's fault, or the manufacturers fault?

This is a point that is brought up in paragraph 9, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -the driver or the manufacturer?"" A whole new set of laws will be needed in order to accomadate this new type of car. Even if new laws are created for these cars and it is made easier to have someone take the blame for an accident how will anyone know if it is truly their fault?

Besides the loss of skill and the legal issues for if and when these cars malfuntion, there is also an issue of these cars being easily hacked. It is getting easier and easier for people to acces sensitve information with everything thing being placed online and creating these cars is just adding another thing to be hacked. It is a very real possiblies that someone may hack into a world leaders car and try to crash it in an attempt at an assination. If this does happen the public would no longer be able to feel safe in even our cars and would be at the mercy of these online hackers.

I believe that, while having driverless cars would be an amazing feat in humankind's technological advancement, there are too many risks involved if these cars are created. We would be losing another skill to technology, computers malfunction on occasion and when one of these car's computer malfuntions and causes a crash who will take the balme, and people with these cars will be putting there lives in the hands of these compurters and the people with the skill to hack and control these computers. It is too dangerous to have these cars and have everyone using them.",0
"Humans tend to think of only the present and not the future. We sometimes only focus on immediate comforts and don't think about how are decisions now will affect our kids and grandkids in the future. Yes, cars are amazing right now. They give us a kind of freedom that is unparalled. But at the same time they hurt the enviroment which hurts not just our future but our present also. Imagine not having a car. I can hear all the gasp now but really think about it. Not having to worry about spending half your paycheck on gas. Yes gas prices are down but for how long. Without cars you also won't have to worry about spending hundreds of dollars to fix it up when it breaks down. But best of all, not having a car will definetly have positive effects on your enviroment.

I have lost count on how many times my father has complained and stressed out about gas prices and the amount of money it takes to fix up his car when it breaks down. Admitedly gas prices are down. Lower than they've been in a while. But how long will that last before its back to $3.50 for a gallon of gas. And I am sure you could find something better to do with $400 than spend it fixing a transmission. Whatever that is. Not having a car releases stress. Soccer moms are the last person you would expect to give up there cars but in Vauban, Germany, a car free town that is exactly what heidrun Walter has done. She is a media trainer and a mother of two and she said ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". If she can do it we can do it.

A lot of towns and cities are doing things like car free day. Which is where for that whole day everybody walks or uses their bikes and the only motor vehicles on the road are buses and taxis. In Paris, the smog level was so high, higher than Beinjin, China, that authorities banned the used of car on the roads for a while in an effort to reduce the smog level. People who didn't follow the ban were fined 33 dollars. In Bogota, Columbia though it was more of a choice for the people to give up their cars. ""Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car-free day yesteday, leaving the streets of capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" said Andrew Selsky of the Seattle times. This is a program that is being spread to other contries. The goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Although there was gray clouds let loose rain showers now and then it did not stop the huge amount of participants. After three years two other Colombian cities joined the event. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""There people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders"".",0
"Have you every wanted to go visit Venus or just see it through a telascope? Well NASA have been tryign to go and see Venus, and sent robots and other things there to take picture or recording what is going over on the planet. The are a few problems with sending humans to Venus and things could go wrong if we are not prepared to go there. But here is a few problem with sending humans there.

Venus is very common to earth and some call it our sister. It will be very hard to try to have humans walk on planet Venus. In the text it says that ""On the planet sruface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit, and the atmospheric, pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". That means it is going to very hard to withstand the temperature on Venus surface.

Another problem is that in the text it say that "" Beyond high presure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land."" What that mean is that is very challenging to send human on Venus and it could destroy the space ship and other things NASA sends.

Even though Venus has though things as well as earth they both are still very much in common. Studies have shown that Venus has have largely oceans and could have supported life on the planet just like Earth. But still Venus do have some landscape features just like earth. Venus have valleys, mountains, and craters all the same as earth.

Taking a trip to Venus will be a challenge and it will happen some day. NASA will some figure out a way to get there. But Venus is still a little different from earth and dangerous. Venus do have some simliiar like features as earth do. And the planet will remain earths sister.",0
"Technology to read emotional expression of students in the classroom is valuable? Is technology in classrom good for students for teacher can read there emotions. I think it would be good to hvae them in classrooms. Teachers should have them so they can read studets emotions. Here are my three reasons why teachers hsould have technology to read emotional expressions.

If the students like the teacher or any other students. If the teacher uses the technology on the students she can tell rather or not if the students likes her. If the students dont like the teacher can at least try to make that student like her. The teacher can tell if the student is going to give the teacher a bdad time by the teacher emotions.

I mean thats good to know because the teacher can know what student going to give her a bad time.

The students are in a bad mood or something or they getting bullied by a classmate. The teacher can know by using that technology on the student. If the student is in a bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk to what student bully him. I think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bullys. I think that technology would be grate for a school.

I think it could help the teachers know if the students would get that material. Like if they dont get it the teacher can use that technology and know if that student dont get. The teachers would ask that student if the students lie the teacher can use the technology. I think that would be great the teacher can help the student more.

Those are my reasons why technology of emotional expression should be in the classroom. Those are my three reasons why.",0
"Imagine that you are in scientist at NASA, the man that you worked with was an photographer of Mars. As the man comes in he as an Trapper keeper as he is walking down towards your office. He shows you the photographs that he took when he was outterspace on the planet Mars. He noticed something about the picture and he tells you to look at it and ask you what do you see, you tell him that you see an figure that looks like an face. Then he agrees with you, you start to jump to conclusions and ask if it is made by aliens or is just a regular landform. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see. The note on the paper was stated "" huge rock formation."" As they are passing around the picture for everyone to see one of the co-workers had assumed it was made/formed by an alien. You and a couple of your workers were talking and assumed that it was just a regular landform and changed as the years went by. The manager had did a little debate, if they thought it was made by an alien they would have to go on one side and if they thought it was just a natural landform that is going to change as the years go by they would have to go on the other side. The people of NASA that thought it was an alien artifact, had to explain and decribe why. One of them volunteered and said that they think it is made by an alien because there is no way that it is just going to change through the years. You interupt him and say that is possible because many things change over the years, policies, laws, taxes, and many more things. You explain to them that it is not made by an alien becuase the photographer of viking 1 and viking 2 goes around and takes pictures of the planet as it circles around then they noticed something different about the figure when the picture was shown. The people that is on your side agree with you and say that you are true so they ask for more evidence to make your statement better than what it was. So you tell them that what the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. You and the co-workes take the last look of the picture and you are amazed. As the years goes by you see that the face doesnt appear on anymore of the picutures from the time it started to the time it ends ( 1998 - 2001. )",0
"The challenges of exploring of Venus can be the differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. It might challenge you in the that that you dn't have anything to help you get ther like astronoits. It can challenge you when you near the sun or when you trying to get to it, sometimes the sun can catch up on us. On the plnet's surface, temperatures verage over 800% Degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure id 90 times greater than what we experiene on our own planet.

The other scoholsr college don't be like where we at right now. Like some people or every human being can't breath on another planet.

BEyond the high pressuure and heat, Venusian geologyand weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquick, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land and on its surface.

There's a lot of things that can challenge you from exploring to the Venus. You need something that you can fly with or even the things that are saty for ever like your astronoit should be full or have somehting that still can turn it on and the things that I don't know.........",0
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Not all of studying Venus is dangerous and risky. There are good things and bad. Have you ever heard really disturbing things or pleasing things about Venus?

There are dangerous parts while studying Venus, such as the temperature being 800 degrees on there and the atmoshperic pressure it 90 times greater than what we experience. Which means, its a very dangerous planet and extremely hot. Having a planet that is that hot, nothing can survive being on it.

Even though Mercury is the closest to the Sun, its still not the hottest. The spacecrafts that has been sent up to has not survived or landed. In more than three decades, there has not been one that has landed. People consider it to be a challenging planet due to spacecrafts not being able to touchdown.

While studying Venus, there's not all dangerous parts, there are good.

Venus has been known to be the most Earth-like plant. Venus once was covered with large oceans and couldve supported forms of life, but how the wheather is not, its unlikely. Scientists are really eager to study Venus. Despite whatever the risks are, they are willing to take them just to get up close Venus and understand the planet. NASA has recently been looking for other ways to approach it. Some electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested and has lasted three weeks in on Venus's surface. Mechanical computers that played a role during World War ll. They are extremely powerful, flexible and quick but most importantly, it has been more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Studying Venus has value and people who take the time to study good and bad things about it are true scientists.",0
"Hello, Mr. Senator i'm writing this letter to you because i'm in favor of keeping the Electrocal College. I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". There are five reason's im in favor of the electrocal college, One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"".

The second reason is Everyone's President ""The electroral College  requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

In the 2012 elections Romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" He doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. The third reason is the Swing States ""The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" Voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . The forth reason is Big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

The fifth Reason is Avoid Run-Off Elections ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents. There are alot of people that want the elctions to change but i think this is the best way to elect presidents. Mr. senator i hope you have read my letter and that you consider wjat i have wrote on this letter.",0
It's 50/50 because sometimes doing things like reading peoples emotions with some tech device that someone made could make. The person they doing to they could get angry or not trust them if it was a friend thta did that to them or. Then some people could like it they could like how they feel how there emotions really do apper on a device that can read emotions or show. The percent you got for each one and there is other things thta could read your emotion muscles and many other things like going to a mirror and try something that could show youn that emotion you have by making faces that could reveal your emotion. Thers many ways you could show your emotions but if a some tech device does that for you and gets that wrong could get people mad or just beleave it. There dosn't have to be no tech device to show your emotion you can find that out yourself your yourself there isnt any one other you be yourself don't a device do that be great and show the emotions you want to other see that your happy.,0
"Is there an advantage to limit the car usage ? There alot of diffrent advantages like promoting,protection and bills .lets talk more about the advantages a little more . lets get this moving !

The frist advantage is promoting. the united states who is promoting the new communities that are less dependent on cars , (rosenthal) if you think about its a good thing because then it gives us less usage and thats a good thing not a bad thing for the people who think so its not .promoting is like you trying to sell somthing to someone and making it sell .thats what you call promoting somthing. the goal is to promote alterative transportation and reduce smog,(selsky)

The second advantage is that the protection. If the usage is reduce then the the greenhouse gases will reduce emissions from tailpipes ,(rosenthal) and thats a good thing becuase if you think about it it cant be a bad thing and never will be a bad thing .The greenhouse gases are a good thingnot somthing bad it helps plants grow. Millions of colombians biked,skated or took buses ,(selsky) and that even uses less green house gases.

The third advantage is bills. There will be bills passed 80 percent of apprpiation have gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport, (rosenthal) and that makes it better if we have bills passed because that mean that we can do more if the laws are passed by the government. It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars,(selsky).

Well at last i can warm this up the three advantages are that promoting , protection and the bills . That all helps  limit the usage of the cars. well thats all for now.",0
"My fellow citizens, there are many reasons why we all should depend less on our cars as a way to travel or to get to one place to anouther. One of the many reasons is that there are some neighborhoods that are doing it so that their families can not drive a car and if they do they have to pay money, and there are already many places that are doing car free days or somethimg like that.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal there is a city in germany named VAUNBAN were they can not use cars and if they do use cars then they would have to park it in a place that is very far away and they would have to pay a total of $40,000 to buy that parking space this is better because there are many ways that polution can polute the earth and we do not want that to happen.

Also there are many places that are doing car free days in which the citizens must not use there cars and ride the busses to work so that there izs less polution. this is good because there will be a major decrease in polution which is good for the earth and also good for the soul.

In conclusion i think that there should be less places for cars to drive and polute the world and mother earth and you should to.",0
"Dear Florida senator, this letter is to discuss my opinion about the voting system for how the new president of the United States of America should be elected or for how the current president should serve another term. The main topic for this letter, is wether or not we should keep the Electoral College or disregard it and go to popular vote. Giving this topic into consideration, it should be best if we switch to popular vote. Candidates not focusing their attention on all the states and that the outcome could be a tie are the different aspects on why we should abolish Electoral College and bring forth popular vote.

To begin with, candidates don't focus on trying to get all the states to vote on them in Electoral College. The explanation for this is because since its the ""winnertakeall"" system, the competitors disregard the states where they know they're not going to win over the majority. They don't even show up to the states or try to win them over. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"" quoted from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. Some might say that this is not a huge issue, but it is to the states that are being ignored. They want equality and a chance to be recognized by each of the rivals. It is clear to see that the candidates give no sign of importance to states that have slim chances of them voting for himher.

Continuing on further, the Electoral College's outcome could end up in a tie. In a result of this mishap, the state delegates, from the House of Representatives, start to vote for the president. The vicepresident is chosen by the The Senate. Each state has one vote to choose which side their rooting for. The silver lining in this decision is that, different states have different amount of population, so it's unfair for all the states to have the same amount of power in choosing the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" taken from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. People doubt that there will ever be a tie but they're were close ones in 1968 and 1976. There's no doubt that, if a tie happens in the Electoral College, everything would go down south.

To sum it all up, reasons why we should switch out of Electoral College is because candidates don't focus on every state and that the final outcome might end up to be a tie. The Electoral College should be abolished due to these reasons. Popular vote is the best for our country. It'll help the voting system by an abundant amount. Please take this into consideration senator and make the correct decision.",0
"I think others should join the program because you could help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more. Caring for the animals is a big job too they have to be watered and fed two or three times a day. Also many things need to be picked up like bales of hay and bags of oats. This is a really big thing to people to have our help. It is a good idea to try and help out.

I have experienced from my aunt Katies farm as a young boy, I worked very hard so that prepared me,but not for the dangers of the sea. My job is to cheak on the animals every hour,its not all that bad. One night though it was pretty scary i was making my hourly report to the captain and some things happened. It wasnt that bad but im glad im here today. There is also lots of time to have fun on board. Like on return trips when the animals had been unloaded. I also played volleyball and baseball games with the cowboys in empty holds.

These are the many reassons why i think others should try joining the program. You not only have to work, you get to have fun while working with others. It may sound scary but its not,once are used to it. It feels pretty good to get that kind of offer. Also just to be able to help out.",0
"I most defintely agree with the scientists behind the Facial Action Coding System. By having the ability to read a student's emotions the world of education could make huge strides. By simply altering a lesson to fit a child's personality, the lesson could become more enjoyable and less challenging for the child.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" If Dr. Huang is in fact right about his technology's potential, children all over the world could become better educated. From my own personal experience I know that when the lesson deals with something I am less interested in I become bored, but if the lesson metions something I enjoy, then it becomes ten times easier.

Dr. Huang also says that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This is one of the most important lines in the article. By saying this, Dr. Huang opens up a world of oppurtunities for his technology. Many teachers around the world would agree that their students when talking, commuicate more with their emotions than physical words. These teachers would be able to know how their entire class was feeling as soon as they walked in. This would enhance the teacher's teaching style for the day ,and increase the students learning oppurtunity.

Dr. Huang's final arguement is also very important. He says when reffering to nonverbal human communications that, ""Computers need to understand that to."" Dr. Huang believes that computers must learn to read the human emotions, and I agree. This generation is becoming more and more about technology, and most schools have converted completely to technology based schooling. If every school had the ability to use the Facial Action Coding System, the intelligence of this generation and generations to come would continue to grow exponentialy.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a huge new technology that would make huge improvements to classrooms. Its ability to recognize emotions would not only benefit students, but would benefit the teachers of those students. The intelligence of our generation and genrations that preceed us will continue to grow with the use of FACS.",0
"With the rise of technology and accesability, students in schools are bound to wonder away from the current lession and tred towards their phones in the face of bordom or general stress. How can we fix this you may ask, with emotion detecting technology. This technology can help schools in that it focuses on specific muscle groups, can detect false emotions, and can help students get beck to the task at hand, school.

First off, how does this technology even recognise emotion? Emotions are always displayed by body poster, facail exspressions, and speech. This technology primarilly focuses on facil exspressions. By focusing on 44 major muscles and a 3D model created within the software through a camera, can effectively distinguish 6 basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the must move like human muscles....six basic human emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" This technology works so well in fact that it was able to calculate the emotions on a painting. The one and only, Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. In this instance of the painting, the software concluded that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This being said, you can see all of these features in the painting with her smile; however, her smile is also seems to be hiding other small emotions that can be portraied as insecure but wholesome. If this technology can effectivly 'see' the portrable emotions off a painting, then it can most definatly can be used within the school systems.

What about the common conseption that students go to school with a smile but arn't really happy? It can do this too. It comes to that facail movements can be seen as true or false by the muscles that are being used in that moment in time. Such as the muscle group, zygomatic major, used in a genuine smile; however, in a false smile you also use the risorius. ""But in false smiles...using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" The usefulness of this technology doesn't stop at just being able to identify false smiles but teachers can use this information to more effectively connect with the students. When a student is a distracted by stressers, they can't focus, and when they can't focus, it makes the teachers look like they arn't doing their jobs properly by the test score of the students because of it. This stratigy however, is nothing new. In the eyes of an exspert, facail exspression tell your true intentions. ""To an experts, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" Thus, this late technology doesn't seem to far fetched to use in our schools.

As I breafly mentioned in the last pharagragh, students need to be able to focus in order to be seccesesful in school. With modern stressers that teachers sometimes don't see as big deal, students on the other hand may lead to distraction. With these stressers far and wide, how do we identify them? By using the facail recognition software. Say for instance a student as his or her mind elsewhere besides the classroom and is missing out on a major transition lession that is the key to the next few lession. They won't get it and will further lead into new problems. But say that the software picks up on the student and detects that he or she is feeling angered, depressed, or just has a lack of intrest. This software can then send the data to the teachers computer thus letting them know that they may need a recap or support in general. Thus further action can be taked by the teacher to strengthen the bond of students and teachers. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Another way that it can be used in the classroom as if the students is angered and frustration is building inside because their minds are in two places at once to only confuse them even more. The software can be designed to shut off the computer, alowing the student to take a breath and contemplate on what is wrong themselves before an intructer aid them in the personal mater before continueing on into the lesson as a whole. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above yours eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" In short, the possibilities are atronomical when thinking of incorperating them into a schools systems.

In short, the addition to facail recognitions systems into the schools is a great idea. Thus it can recogize emotions effectively, detect false emotions, and help students regain focus within the classrooms.

The entirity of this essay used ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto to form my response.",0
"According to this the technology giving is this passage tells students that they can read your emotions by FACS computer software. They say can read people emotion such as- happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. thier process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. As giving the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. A example they give us for a happy and sad description is, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. This technology can also occur towards video games also for example , The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. This passage also lets you know that, your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.",0
"From reading the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", I have figured out that driveless cars have been a long time coming. People have been thinking and working on them for years now. There are pros and cons to driveless cars. For the most part driveless cars would not be a bad idea to throw into the world. If driveless cars passed the laws, you would not have to do much work going places, with time the cars are going to get better and more high tech, and they seem to be safe.

Someone gets into their car and does not have to worry about touching the steering wheel, they just have to turn the car on. That is what it would be like if driveless cars come in the future. The family or a person can just sit in their car without paying attention to the road. On the other hand, a person does have to pay some attention to the cars actions because the car might need their help. For the most part, driveless cars would make life more easy-going. Some people dread having to drive long distances to get to the location they are going to but with driveless cars, it would be no trouble to hop in the car and sit in there while the car does it all for you.

The best part about technology is it is always improving. People are always discovering better ways to do things and improvements in how to do those things. With driveless cars, they can be doing many tests on them and trying out different ways til they get the driveless car reliable for people to trust. Everything improves over the years and driveless cars are one of them. In the future, people are going to find more advanced ways to put in the driveless car to make it a better, more trusting car.

Only a hand full of states are allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Most states have concerns but some states are willing to work with the manufactorers. If more states allow their state to test computer-driven cars, it would make it easier to find ways to improve on the car. Driveless cars are a big deal and they need to be the safest they can be for the roads they will be on. So far the driveless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves and it is only 2016. The future holds so much more.

Although there are many things that need to be worked on before they let driveless cars on the road, it is a good idea to keep improving the vehicles. If people keep working hard at it, no telling what the driveless car will be like over the years. It is important to make the best car possible. There is already so many great things going for the driveless car. If they keep testing the cars and finding ways to make it better, it will eventually make a very safe driveless car.",0
"Driverless cars are the cars of the future. Humans are getting lazier and lazier and we need technology to fulfill our needs. Driverless cars are the perfect solution to our laziness. They are safer and more reliable than regular cars. Regular cars pose a threat to our safety. Regular cars have to be driven by drivers who aren't always paying attention to their surroundings.

Driverless cars may sometimes need to be driven by a user in certain situations. In the event of road work or an accident, the driver must take over the wheel and steer around the hazard. Companies are working on new technology so that cars become completley driverless. Companies are trying to put car-entertainment systems in vehicles so the driver is entertained.

In a few years, there will be driverless cars. There is no doubt about that. It is just a metter of when, and how they will come about. I am all for driverless cars. They are the future of automobiles.",0
"Do you think the seagoing cowboys is a good job? Well I do and here are some reasons why. You can spend lots of time with diffrent animals you can also spend alot of time out on the clear sunny ocean, and most of important of all you are helping people. When you are out on the ocean you can have alot of fun and join very easily. To think of it I joined just from my freind inviting me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Spending alot of time with different animals on a ship is amazing. You get to feed, take care, and have alot of fun with them. Taking care of those young cows and mules can be alot of fun they can sometimes be funny and they can comfort you. Imagine if there was a really bad storm you will always have to cows and mules to keep you company. Would'nt you love being around lots of anmals?

When you get taken over seas to help people it feels good to know you are helping people in need. What if you were those people who needed help to get your countrie recovered from a bombing? You would want somebody or someone to help you recover. This is another reason why you should come and join the seagoing cowboys you can be someone who helps people in need of your assistance. This is another reason why you should join us.

Think of being on a cruse except with animals that is what it is like to be over the seas with the seagoing cowboys you can see the sunny clear ocean and there is plenty of fish. You will have a beutiful veiw of the nice pretty clear ocean. If your lucky enough you can even see the sight of diffrent fish. You can even get the chance to catch them if you wish. There is lots of diffrent things you can do over seas and we also get to help different countries.

In conclusion, you should join seagoing cowboys because you can have alot of fun if you enjoy being over sea with alot of animals see different fish help countries and be the best person you can be. Other things you can do are fencing,boxing,reading,vollyball, and baseball so if you enjoy these activities then you should consider joining the seagoing cowboys. When you are doing those activities it can pass the time if you are missing your family. These are reasons I think you should join the seagoing cowboys.",0
"In the past, the act of driving was a mandatory ability to possess, but as time progresses, the use of personal cars is declining. The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.

Pollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don't have a large influence on pollution, but ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,"" Rosenthal Paragraph 5. Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" Rosenthal Paragraph 34. The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" Duffer Paragraph 10. As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" Duffer paragraph 14.

In order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life,"" Rosenthal paragraph 6. These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" Rosenthal paragraph 6. Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a closeknit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,"" Rosenthal paragraph 9.

Not only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'"" Selsky paragraph 24.

In addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.

In conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car.",0
"In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyways. Could Miami ever be made a car-free community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Car-free communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to car-free lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient (Rosenthal, Selsky). Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's city-wide car-free day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 (Selsky). A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" (Rosenthal).

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for ... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal). Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear (Duffer). Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more eco-conscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency (Duffer).

Car-free communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though; car-free communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them (Rosenthal, Selsky). Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in city-typical, and definitely Miami-typical, traffic jams (Duffer).

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of car-free lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards car-free communities (Rosenthal). Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or car-pool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues (Rosenthal). Scientists, sociologists, and citizens alike will most likely agree that this move will indubitably be one for the better!",0
"Although there are many challenges to face in exploring Venus, the biggest one is ourselves.

We have let our imagination overtake what we want.

we can imagine crazy, bizard things; but that does not mean we can have them.

And once we let our imagination take control, we lose.

We lose what we actually want and trade it in for what we can imagine and know we cannot have.

But our imagination is not the only thing getting in the way.

Exploring Venus is a very risky task.

With temperatures higher than 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure ninety times greater than anything we can ever experience on Earth.

The real question is, ""Is exploring Venus worth the risks?""

Well of course it is!

Every single thign we do has its risks, but that does not stop us from doing things.

We should not turn down an opportunity to explore the great universe we live in simply based of hardships.

Just becasue it is hard does not mean is it impossible.

Venus is the closest planet we have to ourselves.

In paragraph two, Venus is reffered to as '""Earth's 'twin'.""

Venus is the closest thing we have to know what our Earth may or may not turn into.

It is the only thing we can compare ourselves to.

If the conditions on Earth turn into those of Venus, exploring Venus only brings us life.

We can not take away life just because it gets hard!

The fact that it is hard is what should be pushing us to keep exploring.

There is so much we can learn from Venus that we do not even know and probably will not be able to comprehend.

So that is why we need to explore Venus.

We need to explore so that we can learn more about the place we live and the places around us.

Venus is our neighbor, we need to know that our neighbor is safe.

If we do not protect Venus, we are not protecting ourselves.

Through all of the hardships and dangers, we need to keep pursuing to get to Venus.

The more we learn about Venus, the more we can compare and contrast and see if the conditions on Earth are anything like those of Venus.

If we give up on our neighbor, we give up on ourselves.

Venus deserves to be explored and we, as a nation, deserve the chance to explore it.

Not just for the bettering of Venus, but also for the future of Earth.

"Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.

The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.

By limiting car use an finding other means of transportation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with their companion riding a twoseated bike. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of carpooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.

Limiting cars can have multiple advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.",0
"In Support of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to share my reasons for opposing a change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a direct popular vote. It consists of a process where electors are chosen based on the number of members in their state's Congressional delegation, including Representatives and Senators. Each candidate running for President has their own group of electors, who are generally chosen by their political party.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College system ensures a clear winner, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, incentivizing candidates to campaign nationwide and appeal to a diverse range of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a unifying President who represents all regions of the country. As no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that the President takes into account the interests of all regions, preventing the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents in regions that may not be strongholds for a particular candidate.

The Electoral College also gives significance to swing states, allowing for a more focused and meaningful campaign. Candidates are encouraged to concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, ensuring that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates' policies and plans. This fosters engagement and informed decision-making among voters in swing states.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance between small and large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to a disparity in representation, the Electoral College guarantees that all states have a voice and influence in the presidential election process. Large states receive more attention from candidates due to their higher number of electoral votes, ensuring that their concerns and priorities are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time, resources, and potential complications in the election process. History has shown that the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even in cases where a candidate has only achieved a plurality of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several benefits and serves as a vital component of our democracy. It ensures a clear and certain outcome, promotes a unifying President who represents all regions, encourages meaningful campaigning in swing states, provides balance between small and large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and advocate for its preservation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective as you deliberate on this important issue. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or require further information. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States' presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers several benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3% of the popular vote. This indicates that the Electoral College aligns the interests of the states and prevents a few densely populated areas from dominating the entire election process. With the current system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear result and avoiding disputes over the outcome.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate cannot rely solely on the support of one particular region and must consider the interests of the entire nation. This ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs and concerns of citizens from different regions, preventing a ""regional favorite"" from neglecting the interests of other parts of the country.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Swing states play a crucial role in election outcomes as they receive the most attention and information from candidates, resulting in more thoughtful and informed voters. This system ensures that candidates have a genuine interest in engaging with and addressing the concerns of swing state voters, ultimately improving the overall quality of the campaign.

The Electoral College also preserves the weight of larger states in the political balance. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. By considering both population and state size, the Electoral College balances the representation of both large and small states. This way, presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to the needs and concerns of both populous states like Florida and smaller states like Wyoming, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for complicated run-off elections. Under this system, a candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the clear winner, eliminating the need for further rounds of voting. This prevents political instability and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the numbers from the 2012 election indicate that eligible American voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the impact on the national outcome. The Electoral College system has not hindered citizen participation in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several advantages that promote a fair and balanced presidential election. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system in our country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Limited car usage can provide significant benefits for communities and the environment. According to multiple sources, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can help address serious issues like pollution, traffic congestion, and climate change.

Air pollution from traffic emissions poses major health risks. As Passage 1 notes, vehicles are a leading source of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides which contribute to respiratory illnesses. Limiting personal car trips would decrease these harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere. Public transit produces significantly fewer emissions per passenger than private cars. Transitioning some drivers to buses or trains could thus help cities attain cleaner air.  

Traffic congestion not only wastes people's time but also fuel as cars sit idling. Passage 2 refers to how a growing number of vehicles has led to more time stuck in congestion. If a portion of commuters shifted to alternative modes of transport like cycling, walking or public transit, there would be fewer cars competing for road space during peak hours. This could reduce vehicular bottlenecks and free up traffic flow. With less congestion, fuel costs from idling would also decline, providing an economic benefit.

Additionally, restricting car usage would lower greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector according to Passage 3. As one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution, curbing automobile dependence can make an impact in mitigating the carbon footprint. Low-emission public transit, walking and cycling can replace short-distance car trips which significantly damage the environment. Transitioning to more sustainable modes will support efforts to curb global warming for future generations. 

In summary, limiting car usage through promotion of public transit and active mobility brings multiple advantages by reducing air and noise pollution, traffic congestion, and emissions responsible for the climate crisis. A balanced multi-modal transportation system with fewer personal vehicles can offer communities cleaner air and a more efficient movement of people and goods.",1
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, even in the face of significant dangers. While exploring the harsh Venusian environment presents obvious physical hazards, the potential scientific rewards outweigh these risks. The article provides three key pieces of evidence to support continuing Venus exploration.

First, Venus remains one of the last unexplored worlds in our solar system. With surface conditions resembling those of early Earth, Venus could offer insights into the evolution of terrestrial planets and habitability. Understanding Venus may also shed light on Earth's climate history and future. Second, modern robotic technologies have made exploring Venus’ extreme environment more feasible. The article notes landers and probes have survived far longer on Venus than initially expected, exploring potential landing sites and gathering valuable data. Finally, atmospheric studies of Venus can address questions about climate change and greenhouse effects on Earth. Venus serves as a natural laboratory for observing runaway greenhouse warming, with lessons applicable to our planet. 

While exploring Venus certainly entails risks due to the overwhelming atmospheric pressure and surface heat, the scientific knowledge to be gained justifies facing these dangers. Studying Earth’s enigmatic sulfuric acid-laden “sister planet” may unlock mysteries relevant not only to Venus itself, but also climate science and the development of life in the cosmos. Robotic missions further minimize risks to human explorers. Overall, the author presents a persuasive case that, through persevering robotic study, Venus can continue yielding unprecedented scientific returns to advance understanding of terrestrial planet formation and evolution—making ongoing Venus exploration a worthy goal worth pursuing despite intrinsic hazards.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a system of election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that should be considered.

Firstly, the Electoral College system guarantees the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, which has the potential for disputes and claims of tampering, the Electoral College results are more definitive. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant majority of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote. With the winner-take-all system in place, each state's indivisible electoral votes create a clear winner and reduce the likelihood of a tie. This certitude ensures a smooth and decisive election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters a sense of representation for all regions and states. A candidate must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on regional favoritism to win the presidency. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and listen to the concerns and interests of voters from different regions. By ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to guarantee a win, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation for all areas of the country.

The system also incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. While critics argue that this leads to campaigns focusing solely on these states, the fact remains that swing states receive the most attention and information from candidates. Voters in these states become more engaged and thoughtful in evaluating the candidates' policies and promises, knowing that their votes will play a crucial role in deciding the election. This engagement and informed decision-making should be considered valuable aspects of the Electoral College system.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance to the political weight of large states. In a popular vote system, candidates would likely concentrate their efforts on densely populated areas with larger voter bases. However, with the Electoral College, states of different sizes and populations are represented more equally. This ensures that candidates must consider the interests of both large and small states during their campaigns, preventing the neglect of smaller states' concerns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This situation can lead to prolonged and complicated election processes. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the strain on the electoral system and providing a smoother transition to the next administration.

While critics claim that the Electoral College undermines the importance of individual votes and discourages participation, the data suggests otherwise. Participation rates in presidential elections remain high, with approximately half of the eligible population casting their votes. Voters are motivated to express their political preferences, rather than merely relying on the belief that a single vote could decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers essential benefits that should not be overlooked. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes nationwide representation, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These advantages support the preservation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States.

I respectfully urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change the current system. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a direct election by popular vote. In this letter, I will present my reasons for this stance, addressing counterclaims and using evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to disputes over the popular vote. The winner's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, which leads to a more decisive victory. This not only provides a sense of certainty and legitimacy to the outcome, but also minimizes the risk of prolonged post-election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. This requirement prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and encourages them to campaign across the country. This is crucial for a successful president as it helps to avoid regional disenfranchisement and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, regardless of the region they reside in.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to allocate attention and resources to swing states. As Judge Posner notes, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus on these toss-up states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who are likely to be more thoughtful in their decision making. It also prevents candidates from ignoring certain states where they would have no chance of winning, as they know that every state contributes to their electoral vote count.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. Judge Posner rightly points out that this system restores some balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the voices and concerns of both big and small states are heard and considered during the campaign, which would not be the case in a solely popular vote system.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a winner is declared, as pointed out by Judge Posner. This eliminates the need for additional elections, which could complicate the electoral process and potentially lead to greater uncertainty.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections suggests that this concern is not substantial. As Bradford Plumer notes, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their individual vote may not swing the entire election. Voters participate to express their political preferences and engage in the democratic process, even if their state's outcome seems certain.

In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining certainty, ensuring trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, balancing the political weight of states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. Despite some criticisms and calls for change, the Electoral College remains a valuable component of our democracy as established by the founding fathers. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals related to the electoral process in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving the interests of our state and our country.

"Dear Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our state concerning the present means by which we elect the President of the United States - the Electoral College. This subject has been contentious for decades and today, I wish to voice my support for it, maintaining that we should continue to elect our President through this process as opposed to adopting a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote [1]. It involves the selection of electors, who then cast votes for the President and Vice President - thereby presenting a method for balanced representation [2]. 

I acknowledge the criticism against the Electoral College. Critics, like Bradford Plumer, argue that it is an anachronistic system that can distort the true will of the people via the “disaster factor” and ignores voters' preferences in non-swing states [11, 13]. Plumer, and others, favor moving to a system of direct democracy where the candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. However, I argue that retaining the Electoral College has crucial benefits that outweigh the identified cons.

Judge Richard A. Posner, a renowned legal scholar, presents five compelling reasons for retaining the Electoral College. Firstly, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome. As Posner points out, the likelihood of a dispute over the popular vote is more pronounced as contrasted with an Electoral College vote, due to the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeding his share of the popular vote [18].

Secondly, the electoral system ensures the President-elect has trans-regional appeal. The election winner must appeal to a broad range of regions, implying a candidate's message should cater more universally, advocating for national unity [19]. 

Thirdly, the system encourages focus on swing states that often bear varied demographics, which inadvertently promotes the representation of a broad array of voters' interests [20]. 

Lastly, it also addresses the challenge of unequal representation in the Senate by giving more political weight to large states, [21] and dodges the issue of run-off elections by creating a system that usually delivers a distinctive winner without necessitating run-offs [22].

I acknowledge that no system is flawless. However, the benefits of the Electoral College - promoting national unity, mitigating election crisis, preserving balanced representation, and fostering a robust democracy - outweigh its pitfalls. 

Thank you for your consideration of my perspective on this matter. I would appreciate any thoughts you have regarding the Electoral College debate.

"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology might help teachers identify how engaged or interested students are in the lessons, and notice students who need emotional support. It could provide teachers insights into students' understanding of the material based on their facial reactions. This could potentially improve teaching methods to better meet students' needs. However, there are also privacy and ethical concerns. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent could make some students uncomfortable and infringe on their privacy. It may discourage natural emotional reactions if students feel like they are constantly being watched and analyzed. There is also a risk of misinterpreting facial expressions, as cultural and individual differences exist in emotional expression. Before using this technology in classrooms, more research needs to be done to address these issues and determine if the benefits truly outweigh the risks. Parental consent would also be necessary. Overall, while FACS may provide some useful insights for teachers, schools must tread carefully and prioritize students' well-being, development and privacy when considering invasive technologies in the classroom.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and voter, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. It is highly unlikely for a dispute to occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system in most states, where even a small plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely to govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians to pay attention to a diverse range of states and their issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing states receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those states to make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing states also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large states by providing them with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides malapportionment of large states by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates to allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated states. This ensures that large states receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner to emerge.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is worth noting that the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides to the democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure a certain outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, provide weight to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all compelling reasons to preserve this system. I respectfully urge you to take these factors into consideration when discussing any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision-making process. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Favoring the Preservation of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are those who argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several benefits that should be considered before any changes are made.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As Judge Richard Posner points out in his article, ""Certainty of Outcome,"" the winner-take-all system in each state ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, as the outcome is more definitive. Furthermore, the Electoral College system makes it highly unlikely for a nationwide electoral tie to occur, as the even number of total votes increases the chances of a clear victor.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is everyone's president. In his article, Judge Posner highlights that no single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must appeal to a wide range of regions and demographics in order to secure victory. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College promotes a sense of national representation and prevents candidates with only regional appeal from becoming president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, as explained by Judge Posner in his piece, ""Swing States."" This means that voters in these states, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully consider their choices, have a considerable impact on the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to tailor their policies and messages to address the concerns of these swing states, ultimately ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the ability to decide the election.

The Electoral College also offers specific advantages to large states. As Judge Posner argues in his article, ""Big States,"" the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In the Electoral College system, a large state like Florida, with a close popular vote, receives a significant number of electoral votes. This incentivizes candidates to pay more attention to large states during their campaigns, ensuring that the concerns of these populous states are adequately represented.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As mentioned by Judge Posner in his article, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections,"" in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and additional costs associated with run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its certainty of outcome, ability to ensure that the president is everyone's president, focus on swing states, representation of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections all contribute to a fair and balanced system. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides significant advantages that should not be overlooked.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to the strengths of the Electoral College and its impact on our democratic processes.

"Introduction:

The idea of life beyond Earth has fascinated people for centuries, and the 'Face on Mars' has been a topic of debate among those who believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. However, after thorough examination and research, NASA scientists have concluded that the Face is merely a natural landform, and not the work of aliens. In this essay, we will examine the claims made by scientists and the evidence provided by them to support the argument that the Face on Mars is just a natural formation and not the work of extraterrestrials.

Body:

The first claim is that the Face is a natural landform, and not the work of extraterrestrial life. Scientists have used high-resolution photographs of the Cydonia region on Mars to study the features of the Face. The images have revealed that the Face is not a unique formation and that there are similar features on Earth, such as the Sphinx in Egypt. The resemblance of the Face to the Sphinx is striking, and it suggests that the formation is a result of natural erosion and weathering.

The second claim is that the Face is not the only unusual feature on Mars. There are many other strange formations on the planet, such as the 'Pyramids of Mars' and the 'Viking Lander'. These formations have been studied by NASA scientists, and they have found that they too are the result of natural erosion and weathering. Therefore, it is not logical to assume that the Face on Mars is the only feature created by aliens.

The third claim is that the Face is not as perfect as it seems. When the image of the Face was first released to the public, it was believed to have been artificially constructed. However, upon closer examination, the formation is not as perfect as it seems. The edges of the 'Face' are not straight, and the 'eyes' do not align perfectly. This suggests that the formation is a natural landform, and not the work of extraterrestrial life.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, NASA scientists have provided evidence to support the argument that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not the work of aliens. The resemblance of the formation to similar features on Earth, the presence of other strange formations on Mars, and the imperfections of the 'Face' all indicate that the formation is a result of natural erosion and not extr",1
"While the ""Face on Mars"" may seem unusual upon first glance, I believe the evidence strongly suggests that it is simply a natural landform and was not created by aliens. There are several reasons to support this claim.

First, the article discusses how images of the Face taken at different angles and lighting show that it lacks the symmetrical features we would expect from an intelligently designed structure. Its appearance changes drastically based on viewing position. A structure created by intelligent beings would maintain clear defined features from all angles. 

Second, the article describes how images of the Face at higher resolution reveal that it is composed of mesas, hills and valleys that are typical Martian geological formations. Its sloping sides and uneven features are characteristic of erosion over millions of years, not precise engineering. If aliens had carved it, we would expect cleaner, straighter lines.

Furthermore, NASA scientists have identified similar natural landforms on Mars that closely resemble human or animal profiles, purely by chance. The Face's resemblance to a humanoid figure is likely also coincidental. Mars' weathering processes can truncate mesas into shapes that happen to look figure-like from certain perspectives.

In conclusion, while initial photos of the ""Face on Mars"" may promote speculation of alien visitation, a careful analysis of higher resolution images and comparisons to other Martian geological formations strongly indicates that it is simply a result of natural erosive forces over extended periods of time. Unless compelling new evidence can be found of artificial markings or materials, the most scientifically sound position is that it was not created by intelligent design but through normal planetary geological activity alone.",1
"The Mystery of the Face on Mars

While the odd shape of the landform on Mars known as the ""Face on Mars"" understandably sparks interests in the possibility of alien visitation, a close examination of the evidence reveals it to be a product of natural geological processes rather than intentional creation. There are several reasons to believe this. 

Firstly, high-resolution images taken by newer Mars orbiters show a very different topography from what gave rise to early speculations of artificial features. The plateaus and mesas surrounding the Face have been revealed as uniform geological layers formed through erosion over long periods of time. Away from deceptive early images, the Face itself lacks any discernible artificial traits when scrutinized at high detail. Its form simply corresponds to the sloping terrain.  

Secondly, similar landforms have been found on Earth and shown to occur through completely natural means. Erosional processes carve the soft rocks and soils of desert regions into irregular shapes that can resemble faces or other objects to observers from some angles. Wind, weather and the force of water shapes terrain into bizarre silhouettes over the millennia. Without intentional design or the presence of sustaining technologies, no civilization could persist on the surface of Mars long enough to fashion explicitly artistic geography.

Lastly, all other materials exploration of Mars has uncovered no archaeological evidence, artifacts, construction traces or other indicators that could suggested past or present life, much less an advanced society capable of terraforming a planet. The Face remains a lone anomalous form without supporting context. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, yet deeper observation has continually failed to uncover anything to substantiate that the Face was artificially engineered rather than a happenstance quirk of Martian topography. 

While imagination fuels dreams of alien contact, science must follow evidence where it leads. In the case of the Face on Mars landmark, all accumulated data points firmly to a natural origin over an artificial one designed by extraterrestrial intelligence. Its ability to spark wonder at perception should not override reason and sober scrutiny of available facts. When these are taken together, the Face stands revealed as just another oddity sculpted by nature, not nourished aliens, on the ruddy plains of our planetary neighbor.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is a growing trend in many parts of the world as cities and communities recognize the benefits of reducing dependency on cars. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the ideas and information provided in the passages. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, communities can improve their quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Quality of Life
One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Passage 2). Residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and more relaxed (Passage 3). By reducing traffic congestion and noise levels, communities that limit car usage create a more peaceful and quiet environment. Additionally, walking and biking become more common, leading to improved physical health and well-being.

Body Paragraph 2: Environmental Benefits
Limiting car usage also has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Passage 5). By decreasing reliance on cars, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality, making them healthier and more sustainable for future generations. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during periods of high pollution, resulting in a significant drop in congestion and smog (Passage 14). Similar initiatives in Bogota, Colombia, have led to a car-free day, reducing traffic and promoting alternative transportation (Passage 21).

Body Paragraph 3: Efficient Land Use and Accessibility
By limiting car usage, communities can utilize their land more efficiently and create better accessibility. Vauban, for example, places stores within walking distance on the main street, reducing the need for malls along distant highways (Passage 6). This approach encourages people to walk or bike to nearby amenities, promoting a sense of community and reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, this shift towards smart planning allows for the development of compact neighborhoods, making public transportation more accessible and reducing the dependence on private cars (Passage 6).

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages for communities. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, cities and suburbs can improve their residents' quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments. With initiatives like car-free days and the promotion of public transportation, we can work towards a future where cars are no longer the linchpin of suburbs. It is essential for communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and prioritize the implementation of sustainable transportation solutions.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to share my perspective on the ongoing debate around the Electoral College system versus selecting the President by a nationwide popular vote. After reviewing information from multiple sources on the arguments for both sides, I believe the Electoral College should be kept as is.

One of the key reasons is that the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a variety of states and regions. If we went to a popular vote system, candidates would likely focus all of their attention on densely populated areas. This could undermine the voices of smaller states and rural communities. As one source explained, the current system encourages geographically diverse campaigning rather than candidates just focusing on big cities. 

Some argue a popular vote would be more democratic since it would align with the nationwide vote totals. However, others point out this ignores the federal character of the U.S. system, with power divided between the national government and state governments. The Electoral College system helps to maintain this balance of federalism by allocating electoral votes partly based on the number of representatives but also providing two votes for each state no matter the population size. This recognizes the importance of both population and the role of states.

It is also worth considering that switching to a popular vote system could potentially reduce voter turnout. Currently, the all-or-nothing allocation of electoral votes in each state helps generate more enthusiasm and motivation for voters since their ballots can really impact the outcome in their state. A national popular vote may not carry the same impact or sense of consequence for voters in most states. Overall, I believe keeping the current Electoral College system best serves the balanced, federalist framework of our democratic system. However, I am open to alternative proposals that could address criticism of the current approach while still maintaining its advantages. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.",1
"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Step Towards Sustainable Living

The process of limiting car usage poses significant benefits not only individuals but also the world. Ranging from environmental preservation to improving lifestyle and quality of urban spaces, car-free or car-reduced communities paves the way for a sustainable future.

Primarily, the environmental advantages of limiting car usage are quite explicit. Less car usage translates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, helping to slow down climate change (Rosenthal, 2009). As per EPA, passenger cars in some regions contribute up to 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2009). On occasions where French authorities enforced partial driving bans due to extreme pollution, it resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion, clear evidence of how car usage contributes to pollution (Duffer, 2014). 

Furthermore, this reduction in car usage also has noticeable health benefits. Improvements in air quality lessen the risk of respiratory diseases caused by pollution (Duffer, 2014). The city of Bogota, throughout their annual car-free day, observed less smog and decreased stress levels among the city residents (Selsky, 2002). 

In terms of urban city development, car-free neighborhoods are emerging as significantly more sustainable. Communities such as Vauban, Germany exhibit improved urban lifestyle due to lesser dependence on cars. The absence of cars resulted in quieter and cleaner streets conducive to walking and biking (Rosenthal, 2009). 

The reduction in car usage also indirectly fosters a strong sense of community. With streets free from cars, residents can freely interact with their neighbours, children can safely play in the streets, and communal spaces can be more efficiently utilized (Rosenthal, 2009).

Moreover, limiting car usage encourages the use of public transportation and biking, providing an opportunity for daily exercise and reducing the costs associated with vehicle ownership and maintenance.

However, this transformation does not solely depend on individual choices, but requires collective effort. Governments and urban developers must prioritize public transportation, develop biking infrastructure, and provide incentives and legislation to foster car-reduced or car-free lifestyles (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that potentially enrich our quality of life and safeguard our environment. As the cases of Vauban, Paris and Bogota illustrated, a shift away from car culture leads to more sustainable, healthier, and community-friendly urban living. To further this cause, it would require a consolidated approach involving adjustments in lifestyle, changes in urban planning, and strong supportive legal frameworks.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of retaining this system for electing the president of the United States. While there are valid concerns raised about the Electoral College, such as its lack of direct democracy and the potential for discrepant outcomes between the popular vote and the electoral vote, there are compelling reasons for keeping this system intact.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a direct popular vote, where disputes over the vote count are more likely to occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the potential for such disputes. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This lessens the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote and provides a clear winner in the election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is not just a regional favorite, but rather someone with trans-regional appeal. Each region in the United States does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates need to appeal to voters from various regions in order to secure the majority of electoral votes. This requirement promotes the representation and consideration of interests from all regions, preventing a president from being solely focused on a specific region's concerns.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to campaign heavily in swing states. As Judge Posner emphasizes, tossing-up states are the ones where the election is ultimately decided. Consequently, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, thoroughly evaluate the competing candidates' proposals, and make informed decisions. This increased attention from voters in swing states raises the overall level of thoughtful voting, which is desirable for selecting the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system restores some balance to the political weight of large states that lose representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a popular vote scenario, large states would enjoy even more influence, potentially overshadowing the interests and needs of smaller states. By awarding electoral votes proportionally to each state's population, bigger states still receive more attention from candidates in campaigns, but not to the point that their influence becomes disproportionate.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections. This is particularly important in cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College system tends to produce a clear winner, eliminating the need for extended and potentially costly run-off elections.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it discourages potential voters in states where they believe their vote will have no effect on the outcome. However, as Judge Posner points out, voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference, rather than ones who believe that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this perceived limitation, voter turnout in the 2012 election reached approximately 50% of the eligible American population, suggesting that voters are still motivated to participate in the electoral process.

In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns with the Electoral College system related to its lack of direct democracy and the potential discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote, the system serves several important purposes. It ensures certainty in the outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages campaigning in swing states, restores balance in representation, and eliminates the need for run-off elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I implore you to seriously ponder the advantages of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to the current system. The preservation of this process is crucial to maintaining a fair and effective means of selecting our nation's president.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing the reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable communities, improve public health, and mitigate climate change.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable communities. The German suburb of Vauban is a prime example of how life can go on without cars. Streets in Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. This design encourages residents to use public transportation or walk and cycle instead. In fact, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This shift towards car-free living reduces traffic congestion, noise pollution, and the need for large parking spaces. It also promotes a stronger sense of community and encourages people to interact with each other.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The article highlights how passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease these emissions and improve air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat intense smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing air pollution, we can reduce the prevalence of respiratory problems and improve the overall well-being of citizens. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling can help individuals lead more active lifestyles, reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Limiting car usage also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming. The decrease in driving observed in the United States suggests a cultural shift away from car dependence, with people opting for alternative transportation options. This shift could have far-reaching implications for carbon emissions and the environment. If the trend continues, it will have a positive impact on reducing emissions and combating climate change. Moreover, limiting car usage can prompt car manufacturers to adapt their business models to cater to changing consumer demands. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, focusing on a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It creates more sustainable communities, improves public health, and helps mitigate climate change. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and fostering a sense of community. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.",1
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthwhile scientific endeavor, in spite of the planet's challenging environment. Several key pieces of evidence support this claim.

One of the strongest arguments put forth is Venus's similarities to Earth. As the author notes, Venus is comparable in size and composition. It is closest in structure to our planet, with implications for understanding Earth's physical history and climate evolution. Even though surface conditions differ drastically today, Venus provides a lens into what can happen when a greenhouse effect spirals out of control. Insights gained about atmospheric dynamics and climate change processes have value as we work to address the same issues here. 

Logistical hurdles are acknowledged, but the author maintains they can be overcome. While the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and intense heat pose clear dangers, exploration strategies outlined demonstrate how robotic probes may safely operate and analyze the Venusian environment. Prior missions have taught lessons that can enhance new design approaches. With dedicated engineering, the author is confident goals of investigating surface composition and activity can be achieved from orbit and even landed platforms.

In summary, the author presents a compelling case for continued Venus exploration despite risks. Strong scientific rationale is provided regarding comparative planetology and climate change. Feasible technical solutions are also proposed to enable more progressed understanding. While difficulties exist, the potential scientific rewards described support that studying Venus remains absolutely worthy as part of comprehensive solar system research. Careful mission planning can maximize productivity while minimizing hazards to craft and personnel. On the whole, the essay convinces the reader that Venus merits ongoing investigation.",1
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris due to smog, and the success of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. By reducing car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change. The example of car-free communities like Vauban, where only 30% of families own cars, shows that it is possible to live without cars and still have a high quality of life.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris highlights how smog levels significantly decreased when cars were restricted. Smog is a major issue in many cities around the world, and car emissions contribute to this problem. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as biking, walking, or public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Promoting alternative forms of transportation is another advantage of limiting car usage. The passage mentions how in Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. This not only promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle but also reduces the need for cars for everyday tasks. Similarly, the car-free days in Bogota encourage people to utilize buses, bikes, or skates for their daily commute. By providing and improving alternative transportation options, we can reduce congestion on the roads and make transportation more accessible for everyone.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. The passage about Vauban highlights how the absence of cars has created a peaceful and pleasant environment, where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children can be heard instead of motor noise. This creates a safer and more enjoyable community for residents. Additionally, car-free zones and pedestrian-friendly streets can encourage social interactions, support local businesses, and improve the overall quality of life in a neighborhood.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive effects of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning strategies and encouraging alternative transportation options, we can build a future that is less dependent on cars and more focused on sustainable and healthy living.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to advocate against changing to a system of election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, plays a crucial role in our democratic process.

One of the main benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower compared to a dispute over the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This creates a clear and decisive outcome in the election.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the president has trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are encouraged to campaign across the country and consider the interests of various regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that all Americans feel represented by the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system enhances the importance of swing states. In a close election, candidates focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This encourages voters in those states to pay close attention to the campaign and be more thoughtful in their decision-making. These swing states become the battlegrounds where the election is truly decided, allowing for a more engaged electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives small states more power, and the Electoral College offsets this by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of highly populated areas and consider the needs of all states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections. By invariably producing a clear winner, it eliminates the need for further rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe their single vote may decide the outcome. In spite of this, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the last presidential election, indicating that voters are still motivated to participate.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system, providing certainty of outcome, ensuring trans-regional appeal, giving importance to swing states, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. While arguments can be made for changing to a popular vote system, the benefits and practicality of the Electoral College outweigh them. It is crucial that we keep the Electoral College and preserve the integrity of our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit Despite Danger 

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case that pursuing the study of Venus is worthwhile, in spite of the planet's extreme dangers. While Venus poses life-threatening conditions on its surface, from the scorching heat to toxic atmosphere, the insight it can provide into Earth's climate history and habitability makes facing those risks worthwhile. 

Key evidence from the article supports this assessment. The author notes that Venus resembles Earth in size and composition yet diverged to become nearly uninhabitable, with surface temperatures hot enough to ""melt lead."" Understanding what drove this divergence could shed light on Earth's future climate trajectory. Additionally, the author argues Venus may hold clues about the earliest conditions on Earth and clues about what transforms a planet into a ""potentially life-bearing world."" These scientific rewards justify confronting the hazards of Venus exploration.

While exploring Venus clearly presents extraordinary challenges, from designing probes able to withstand immense pressure and heat to navigating an atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, the potential scientific payoffs make overcoming these obstacles worthwhile. Venus offers a cautionary tale about runaway climate change and insights into planetary evolution that could help preserve habitability on Earth. Though fraught with danger, continued study of our closest planetary neighbor Venus stands to significantly advance scientific understanding, making it a deserving target of further investigation and exploration despite the risks involved. For these reasons, the author makes a convincing case that Venus remains well worth studying.",1
"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and disadvantages. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. If the computer detects that many students look bored or confused, the teacher would know to adjust their teaching strategy or explain a concept again in a different way. This could improve students' understanding and engagement. The technology could also flag when a student appears upset or distressed, so the teacher can check in on their wellbeing. 

However, constant computer monitoring of students' facial expressions may invade their privacy and make them feel uncomfortable. Students should feel free to naturally react to lessons without always worrying if a computer is analyzing their every expression. They may start to feel self-conscious and unable to fully concentrate on learning. There are also concerns about how the personal data collected about students' emotions would be stored and shared. 

Overall, using this technology sparingly and judiciously could provide some educational benefits by helping teachers adapt their lessons. But constant facial scanning risks having negative impacts on students' privacy, stress levels and ability to freely react and learn. A balanced approach that only occasionally analyzes student expressions, and with strict privacy protections, may maximize the benefits of this technology while minimizing the disadvantages for students. More research would also help understand how different applications of this technology affect learning environments.

In conclusion, while facial recognition could offer valuable insights to teachers, the potential downsides to student wellbeing and privacy must be carefully considered and addressed for its use in classrooms to be justified. A nuanced approach is needed.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and argue against changing to a system of election by popular vote for the president of the United States. While there are valid concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the Electoral College, I believe that it is important to consider the practical reasons for keeping this system in place.

One of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Under this system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his or her share of the popular vote. This ensures that the election results are clear and conclusive, reducing the likelihood of disputed outcomes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could result in a close election and potential disputes over recounts and ballots, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of ""everyone's president."" This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal in order to secure enough electoral votes for victory. As a result, candidates are encouraged to campaign in various regions and address a broader range of issues that are important to voters throughout the country. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on states where they are likely to win and neglecting the interests of other regions.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. In these states, where the race is highly competitive, voters tend to be more engaged and informed, as they know their vote can have a significant impact on the outcome. By giving greater weight to swing states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a greater say in determining the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states more representation per capita than larger states. The Electoral College restores some balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates, as they have a greater number of electoral votes. This system ensures that the concerns and interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps streamline the election process and ensures a clear winner. In situations where no candidate wins a majority, a run-off election can be complicated and time-consuming. The Electoral College prevents this by guaranteeing that a candidate obtains a majority of electoral votes.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for candidates to ignore certain states, the practical advantages it offers outweigh these concerns. It promotes certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, engages swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. These reasons demonstrate why the Electoral College should be retained for future presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and direct popular vote systems before making any decisions.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"The Natural Formation of the ""Face on Mars""

Many viewpoints exist regarding the so-called ""Face on Mars."" While some see evidence of extraterrestrial involvement, a closer examination reveals the Face is most likely a result of natural geological processes. 

Several pieces of evidence from the article support the notion that the Face is a mundane landform rather than an alien construction. First, images from newer Mars orbiters with higher resolution show the Face lacks distinguishing features one would expect of an intelligent construction. Its shape is vague and ambiguous, resembling a human face only from certain angles. Up close, it resembles an eroded mesa or hill more than a sculpture. 

Second, the materials it is composed of - sandstone and other sedimentary rocks - were formed by natural environmental factors like wind and rain erosion over millions of years. These are the same rock types that make up other mesas and hills in the region with no supposed ""faces."" The reddish iron oxide color is also common across the Martian surface and reveals nothing unusual about its composition. 

Finally, details from photos of surrounding areas indicate the Face is actually part of a naturally-formed cliff or hill. Its outline is determined by the bedding planes in which the sediments were laid down over eons, and it aligns with the general topography. These geological features take forms that sometimes resemble recognizable objects by chance alone.  

In conclusion, while an intriguing coincidence, scientific analysis of photos and context reveals the ""Face on Mars"" is quite plainly a natural rock formation shaped by normal environmental processes over immense timescales. Absent clear evidence of artificial construction, the safest conclusion is that no anomalous intelligence was involved in its formation. It remains a testament to the proclivity of the human mind to perceive recognizable patterns, even where none objectively exist. For these evidence-based reasons, I must conclude the face is a product of nature, not aliens.",1
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could provide both benefits and disadvantages. 

One potential benefit is that teachers may gain insights into how engaged or interested individual students seem in the lesson. By identifying facial expressions that indicate boredom, confusion or lack of attention, teachers could more easily recognize when students need additional help or when the lesson may need adjusting. This could help optimize learning for different students. The technology may also help identify students experiencing underlying emotional issues that are impacting their ability to focus, so teachers could intervene with support.

However, there are also privacy and ethical concerns with this type of monitoring. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being constantly tracked and analyzed without consent. Facial expressions often reflect private and subtle internal states that people do not intend to publicly share. Continuous monitoring could undermine student autonomy and the natural development of emotional literacy. It may also lead to misinterpretations if context is not considered, with teachers making incorrect assumptions about how students are feeling.

Overall, while FACS technology could provide insights intended to help student learning, its constant use to read students' emotions risks being an overreach into personal privacy and development. The benefits would need to be carefully weighed against these ethical concerns. Targeted or occasional use focused on individual student needs, with full student consent, may minimize privacy issues while still allowing teachers to gain useful insights through this new technology when specifically aimed to help learning or well-being. More research would also need to evaluate how accurately the technology can interpret emotions in an authentic classroom setting before widespread adoption.",1

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage in society has been gaining momentum in recent years. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote more sustainable modes of transportation. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging alternatives to car travel, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to combating climate change.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In the passage about Paris banning driving due to smog, it is stated that after implementing a partial driving ban, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent. This reduction in car usage resulted in cleaner air and a decrease in pollution levels. By limiting car usage, especially in urban areas with high population density, we can create healthier environments for residents and reduce the negative impact of vehicle emissions on respiratory health.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, highlights how smart planning can result in the development of neighborhoods where cars are not the primary mode of transportation. Instead, residents have access to public transportation, walkable streets, and local amenities within a short distance from their homes. This approach helps reduce the need for long car commutes and promotes a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

Moreover, by limiting car usage, we can also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote a more sustainable energy system. As mentioned in the passage about the end of car culture, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, indicating a potential cultural shift away from personal vehicle ownership. This shift presents an opportunity to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, shared transportation services, and improved public transit systems. These alternatives can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities. By promoting alternatives to car travel and implementing smart planning strategies, we can make significant progress toward a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace these ideas and work together to limit car usage for the benefit of our planet and future generations.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. While some argue that a national popular vote would be more democratic, I believe the Electoral College ensures that smaller states still have a meaningful say in presidential elections. 

If we changed to a popular vote system, candidates would likely only focus their campaigns on large population centers. They would spend all their time in a handful of big cities and ignore the concerns of rural areas and smaller states. This could seriously disadvantage places with fewer people. The Electoral College encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider range of communities across the country. 

It is also important to consider the federal nature of our representative democratic system. The Founders designed the Electoral College with the intention that each state acts as its own independent entity in selecting the president. Awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis by state reinforces this idea of state sovereignty. While some argue this discourages third party candidates, it provides clear incentives for candidates to reach consensus across different state interests.

Of course, there are legitimate concerns about how the Electoral College functions in practice. Some very close national elections have had different outcomes in the electoral vote. Faithless electors also undermine the will of the people in rare cases. However, on the whole the system has worked reasonably well to achieve its original purposes. Rather than a wholesale change, modest reforms like the proportional allocation of electoral votes in some states could help address issues while maintaining the core benefits of the current approach.  

In summary, while electoral reforms deserve discussion, abandaining the Electoral College risks marginalizing less populated areas and weakening federalism. I believe with careful adjustments, the Founders' vision can continue to serve our large and diverse nation well into the future. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

"Hey, I know you think the Face on Mars is like, totally made by aliens and stuff, but let me tell you, it's not! It's just a natural landform that looks like a face because of the way the sunlight hits it.

First of all, the Face is way too big to be made by aliens. It's like, super huge, and it would have taken forever for them to build it. And also, why would they even want to build a face on Mars? It doesn't make any sense!

Plus, the article says that the Face is made out of rock and stuff, and it's just a natural part of the Martian landscape. It's not like, a concrete statue or anything. And the scientists say that the Face is changing over time, like, it's getting smaller and stuff. That means it's not, like, a solid structure that aliens built.

And also, the article says that the Face looks different depending on the angle of the sun. That means it's just a shadow thing, and it's not actually a face at all! It's just, like, a trick of the light.

I know it's hard to believe, but the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It's not, like, a sign that aliens are, like, watching us or anything. It's just a cool thing that nature made. And scientists are still learning about it, so we'll probably find out more cool stuff about it in the future.

So, yeah, the Face on Mars is not made by aliens. It's just a natural thing, and we should be happy that we have such cool things in our solar system to learn about!",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Surname],

I am writing to express my views on an important issue that impacts our nation's presidential elections: the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. Although some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, I maintain that it plays a crucial role in our political system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in elections. As we have witnessed in the past, disputes over the popular vote are not uncommon. However, due to the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure reduces the likelihood of disputes and provides a clear and decisive result, making it more likely that the will of the people is accurately represented.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, candidates must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely focus on winning states with a majority of electoral votes. This ensures that presidential candidates must campaign across different regions, listening to diverse perspectives and addressing the concerns of citizens nationwide. By encouraging candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, the Electoral College fosters a sense of inclusivity and representation for all Americans.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its emphasis on swing states. Consequently, candidates focus their campaign efforts on these states, which can lead to more informed and engaged voters. Swing states receive more attention, leading to increased political discourse, and allowing for a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This system ultimately encourages candidates to listen to and address the concerns of citizens in these states, fostering a stronger connection between elected officials and the people they represent.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance out the influence of big states. The system ensures that large states do not have an overwhelming advantage over smaller states in the election process. The distribution of electoral votes provides a fairer representation of the population, allowing candidates to seek support from a broader range of states. Consequently, this balances power between states and prevents candidates from being solely focused on the interests of densely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College maintains efficiency and stability in our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in non-competitive states, studies have shown that voters still participate in elections even if their state is likely to favor one candidate over another. Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states and listen to the concerns of citizens across the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system. It ensures certainty, promotes inclusivity, encourages candidate engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big states, and reduces the need for run-off elections. While some proposed alternatives may offer changes to the system, they fail to address the core benefits and historical significance of the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these points when deliberating on this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will represent the interests of your constituents while making decisions regarding our electoral process.

"Are driverless cars really the future of transportation? Some say yes, while others are skeptical. Me, personally, I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. The article “Driverless Cars are Coming” by [author’s name] presents both the pros and cons of this technology, and I’m gonna use some of those details to argue against driverless cars.

First of all, let’s talk about the safety concerns. According to the article, driverless cars rely on sensors and software to navigate roads, which means that there’s a high risk of technical failure. Just imagine you’re cruising down the highway, and suddenly your car’s sensors malfunction, causing it to swerve into oncoming traffic. That’s a nightmare scenario that no one wants to experience. Plus, the article mentions that driverless cars might not be able to fully eliminate accidents caused by human error, since they’ll still have to share the road with human-driven vehicles. So, the safety benefits of driverless cars aren’t as clear-cut as some people claim.

Another issue with driverless cars is their potential impact on jobs. The article states that driverless cars could lead to a loss of jobs for human drivers, like truckers and taxi drivers. That’s a major concern, since these jobs provide livelihoods for millions of people. We shouldn’t just dismiss their interests and switch to a new technology without considering the consequences. It’s important to think about how this change will affect ordinary people and their families.

Furthermore, I think driverless cars will make us lose our driving skills. If we rely on cars to do all the work for us, we’ll forget how to drive ourselves. That might not seem like a big deal, but it’s important to have some basic skills, like being able to drive a car, in case of emergencies. What if there’s a blackout or a system failure? We’ll be helpless if we don’t know how to drive.

Finally, driverless cars just aren’t as fun as driving yourself. I know that some people might disagree, but for me, driving is a thrill. I enjoy the feeling of being in control of a car, the wind in my hair, and the freedom to go wherever I want. With driverless cars, that’ll all be gone. We’ll become passive passengers, relying on a machine to take us places instead of experiencing the joy of driving ourselves.

In conclusion, while some people might see driverless cars as the future, I think they’re a bad idea. There are too many safety concerns, job losses, and a loss of driving skills to make them worth it. And let’s not forget the fun of driving, which we’ll lose if we switch to driverless cars. So, let’s slow down and think carefully before embracing this technology. Maybe we should focus on improving public transportation or investing in electric cars instead. There are better ways to make transportation more efficient and sustainable without relying on driverless cars.",1
"While the idea of the ""Face on Mars"" being created by aliens is intriguing, the evidence clearly shows that it is simply a natural landform formed by erosion over millions of years. There are several reasons why the Face was not artificially constructed.

For one, the scale of the structure does not match what would be expected for an intentional monument. At just over 1 kilometer wide, it is far too small to reasonably serve as some kind of message or marker left by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization capable of interplanetary travel. The scale is much more consistent with the size of geological formations shaped by natural forces like wind and water erosion. 

Additionally, when viewed from other angles besides the famous front-facing view, it becomes apparent that the Face lacks any well-defined symmetrical features. Instead, it resembles an oddly eroded mesa or butte that only takes on a superficial face-like shape from one vantage point. If it were truly an artificial construction, it likely would maintain clearer facial features from multiple angles.

Most conclusively, the material the Face is composed of has been scientifically analyzed and shown to be typical sedimentary deposits common throughout Mars, without any anomalous chemical signatures. There is no evidence it contains any construction materials not found elsewhere on the planet's surface. Over millions of years, natural geological processes like rivers carving through layered sediments could easily form an irregular shape that under the right lighting resembles a human face.

In conclusion, while the coincidental facial appearance captured in an iconic NASA photo was intriguing and sparked speculation, thorough scientific analysis reveals the Face on Mars is without a doubt a simple geological landform, not evidence of an alien civilization. The scale, lack of defined features from other angles, and composed of typical Martian sediments all definitively prove it is a product of natural martian geology, not artificial construction by extraterrestrials. The most reasonable conclusion, based on available evidence, is that it was slowly weathered into its present form over the Martian planetary history.",1
"Limiting car usage can provide significant benefits to communities and the environment. Cars are hugely popular and convenient forms of transportation, however their negative impacts should not be overlooked. Reducing reliance on cars can help address problems of air pollution, traffic congestion, and public health issues facing many cities. 

Air pollution from vehicle emissions poses serious risks. As stated in Passage 1, ""motor vehicles are major sources of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter."" These pollutants are linked to respiratory illnesses and other health problems. By driving less and choosing alternative modes of transit when possible, individuals can help lower emission levels in their cities. Passage 2 supports this by noting countries that have implemented policies encouraging public transportation and infrastructure for cycling have experienced drops in vehicle pollution.

Traffic congestion is another issue exacerbated by excessive car usage. As Passage 1 discusses, traffic jams waste time and fuel, and motor vehicle accidents represent a leading cause of injuries. Having fewer vehicles on the road during peak travel periods would alleviate congestion. Passage 3 proposes strategies like workplace flexibility and telecommuting that can reduce commute times and daily car trips. Investing in reliable public transportation, as Passage 2 advocates, gives people low-stress options besides driving.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through individual behavior changes and policy initiatives yields environmental and public health benefits that improve quality of life for communities. Minor reductions in driving, particularly during busy times, can make a meaningful difference. Educating citizens about alternatives and investing in other transit modes are reasonable steps to curb problems caused by vehicle overreliance.",1

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to any efforts to replace the Electoral College with a popular vote system for the US presidential elections. Despite the criticism leveled at the Electoral College in recent years, I believe that it is a crucial part of our democratic process that must be preserved.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures that all states have a say in the election outcome, regardless of their population size. This is particularly important because it prevents highly populated states like California and New York from dominating the election and effectively rendering the smaller states irrelevant. By giving each state a set number of electoral votes based on its population, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and that no state is left out of the decision-making process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College has a long history in the United States, dating back to the founding of the country. It was put in place by the framers of the Constitution as a way to balance the interests of the individual states with the needs of the nation as a whole. It has served us well for over two centuries and has never been the cause of any major electoral issues or controversies.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic because it is possible for a candidate to become president without winning the popular vote. This is a legitimate concern, but it is important to remember that the Electoral College was never intended to be a direct representation of the popular will. Instead, it was designed to ensure that the person elected to the presidency had broad-based support across the country, not just in a few highly populated states.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the continued use of the Electoral College in US presidential elections. While it may not be perfect, it provides a fair and balanced way of electing our president that has served us well for over 200 years. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

A concerned constituent.",1
"Title: Promoting Sustainability Through Reduced Car Usage

In the face of numerous environmental and public health challenges, limiting car usage has been proposed as a strategy to promote more sustainable and livable communities. Evidence from various sources across the globe supports the implementation of this model in both developed and developing nations, citing benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Residents of Vauban, a German suburb, have successfully adopted a car-free lifestyle, evidenced by 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). The elimination of cars’ incessant noise has resulted in a serene environment where the chirping of birds and the chatter of children constitute the primary sounds (Rosenthal, 2009). Vauban’s model of “smart planning” not only discourages car usage but also encourages an active lifestyle through increased walking and cycling. Such planning initiatives can help other cities combat air pollution, a significant environmental issue that arrived in the spotlight when Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to hazardous smog levels (Duffer, 2014).

Car usage restriction, as seen in Vauban and on dysfunctional, smog-filled days in Paris, has also led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a known contributor to climate change (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014). The decrease in car usage, and a shift to more energy-efficient transportation methods, reduce environmental impact and can significantly benefit public health.

Similar outcomes have been observed in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, where the annual “Day Without Cars” campaign encourages residents to use alternative forms of transport, significantly reducing traffic and resultant pollution (Selsky, 2002). The campaign has inspired an overall urban improvement effort, including expanding bicycle lanes and revitalizing public spaces, uplifting the urban quality of life and further promoting a culture of sustainability.

American behavior illustrates a changing trend regarding car usage, heralding beneficial implications for curbing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). In the long run, this could have positive effects on air quality, urban densification, and public health. Additionally, new and innovative commuting arrangements are emerging due to the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps, which provide easier access to shared rides and public transportation (Rosenthal, 2013). 

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are extensive and impactful. Reduced congestion, enhanced public health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a generally improved quality of life can be achieved by fostering a society that values sustainability and propels a shift away from auto-centric communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that a change is feasible and can lead to substantial benefits. Encouraging this transformative shift in urban planning and personal transportation is paramount for a sustainable, more livable future.",1

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, and for good reason. While cars have been a symbol of suburban life and freedom of mobility, they also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, communities can reap numerous benefits. These include reducing emissions, improving air quality, increasing physical activity, and fostering stronger communities.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" it is mentioned that diesel fuel, which is commonly used in France, contributes to smog and air pollution. By reducing car usage, especially diesel vehicles, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier communities.

Limiting car usage also promotes physical activity and better health. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, residents rely on walking and cycling as their primary modes of transportation. This not only reduces emissions but also encourages a more active lifestyle. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and enhance overall well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster stronger communities. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" it is mentioned that car-free days in Bogota, Colombia have been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. These events bring people together, create a sense of community, and encourage social interaction. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors, explore their surroundings, and support local businesses.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and foster stronger communities. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, communities can create a more sustainable and livable environment for their residents. It is important for individuals, governments, and organizations to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing effective strategies to achieve these goals.",1

First of all, let's talk about the environment. Cars produce a lot of pollution, which can be harmful to our planet. According to the passage set, cars produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air and help slow down climate change. Plus, less cars on the road means less noise pollution, which can make our communities quieter and more peaceful.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it's better for our health. Walking, biking, or using public transportation instead of driving can help us get more exercise and stay healthy. According to the passage set, physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to be more active and reduce their risk of these diseases.

Limiting car usage can also help our communities become more connected. When we walk or bike, we're more likely to interact with our neighbors and local businesses. We can say hi to each other, wave, or even stop and chat. This can help build a sense of community and make our neighborhoods feel more friendly and welcoming. According to the passage set, social connections are important for our mental health and well-being.

Finally, limiting car usage can save us money! According to the passage set, the cost of owning and maintaining a car can be really expensive. By using alternative modes of transportation, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and parking. Plus, many cities offer affordable public transportation options, which can be a cheaper alternative to driving.

So, what can we do to limit car usage? One idea is to encourage alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transportation. We can also promote carpooling or using ride-sharing services. Additionally, we can support policies that discourage driving, like increasing parking fees or implementing congestion pricing.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages, including reducing pollution, improving our health, building stronger communities, and saving us money. By making a few changes to our daily routines, we can make a big difference in the long run. So, let's try to reduce our reliance on cars and make our communities healthier, quieter, and more connected. Thank you for reading!",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have implemented various strategies to limit car usage and have experienced positive outcomes. These initiatives range from car-free neighborhoods to car-free days, all aimed at promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating more sustainable communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transportation, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the alleviation of traffic congestion. In cities like Paris, where driving bans were enforced during periods of intense smog, there was a significant decrease in congestion. In fact, congestion in the capital of France was reduced by 60 percent during the driving ban. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time and frustration associated with commuting. With fewer cars on the road, people can travel more efficiently and safely.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The use of diesel fuel, which is common in many countries, including France, has been linked to increased air pollution.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an emerging trend in many parts of the world, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Several case studies illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage, such as the car-free district of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By adopting smart planning strategies, reducing dependency on cars, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and communities can benefit from cleaner air, reduced congestion, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, particularly passenger cars, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times article, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combating climate change. The case of Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars, demonstrates how a car-free lifestyle can significantly reduce carbon footprints.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality and Public Health
Vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution, especially in densely populated cities. The driving ban in Paris due to smog, as reported by the Chicago Tribune, resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This temporary measure brought about a 60% decrease in congestion and highlighted the negative health effects of car usage. By limiting car usage, communities can enjoy cleaner air, reduce respiratory illnesses, and promote overall public health.

Body Paragraph 3: Reduced Congestion and Enhanced Livability
The introduction of car-free districts and car-free days, such as the ones in Vauban and Bogota respectively, showcase the potential for reduced congestion and enhanced livability. These initiatives create space for alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transit. The Seattle Times article on Bogota's car-free day highlights how millions of Colombians experienced a day devoid of traffic jams, promoting efficient transportation and a better urban environment. Additionally, car-free districts result in walkable communities with improved access to amenities like shops, schools, and parks.

Body Paragraph 4: Economic Benefits and Diverse Transportation Options 
Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The New York Times article mentions how car ownership rates have declined even before the recession, indicating a broader cultural shift. This shift led companies like Ford and Mercedes to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with diverse product ranges beyond personal vehicles. By embracing alternative transportation options like car-sharing programs, bike-sharing, and public transit, communities enable residents to save money on transportation costs, reduce the need for parking spaces, and reduce the strain on infrastructure.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Case studies from across the world demonstrate the significant impact of reducing car dependency, from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality to reduced congestion and enhanced livability. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation, and rethinking the car-centric culture, communities can create sustainable, healthy, and accessible urban environments for all. Embracing these changes will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the global effort to address climate change and build a better future.",1
"While some see hints of extraterrestrial activity in landforms like the ""Face on Mars,"" a closer examination reveals it to be a product of nature rather than design. The article provides compelling evidence that geological and erosional forces best explain this formation. 

One of the primary claims made is that the shape and features of the face align with the surrounding terrain. The eye, nose and mouth-like indentations follow the same slopes and strata as the surrounding rock. If erosion gradually wore down the harder rock layers, it makes sense that depressions would form where softer layers existed. This pattern of uneven weathering fits with natural landforming over time rather than intentional design. 

Additionally, when viewed at different angles and times of day with changing sunlight, the face shape is less distinct—it is not a perfect or deliberate formation. Natural terrain often takes on transient or imaginative shapes that vary with perspective. The face lacks precise symmetrical qualities one would expect from an artificial construct. Its blend into the wider hillside suggests a random outcome of environmental forces rather than precision engineering.

Perhaps most importantly, higher resolution images reveal no artificial materials or technology associated with the face. Were it of alien origin, one would expect signs of non-natural substances or structured objects. However, examination found only normal Martian rocks and soil. The lack of artifacts supports an natural rather than artificial or engineered source for the formation. 

In concluding, while patterns in nature sometimes resemble recognizable images, closer scrutiny usually reveals natural causal factors at play rather than intent or design. The preponderance of geological evidence indicates the ""Face on Mars"" is best explained as an example of the transient shapes terrain may take under environmental influences, not alien artwork. Unless compelling new technical data emerges, its identity as a natural landform seems firmly established.",1

In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea and provide evidence from the article to back up my claim.

Body:
The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus. For instance, the author notes that the study of Venus could provide us with valuable information about the Earth's climate system. Venus has a very thick and hot atmosphere that traps heat, causing its surface to reach a temperature of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying these extreme conditions on Venus could help us better understand the impact of global warming on Earth.

Moreover, the author argues that understanding the geology and composition of Venus's surface could help us learn about the Earth's formation. Venus and Earth are very similar in size and composition, so it is reasonable to assume that both planets share some similarities in their geological history. Studying Venus could provide us with information about plate tectonics, volcanoes, and other geological phenomena that could help us understand the Earth's past and present.

The author also notes that exploring Venus could be an excellent opportunity to test new technology and techniques for space exploration. For instance, the development of new materials and equipment that could withstand Venus's harsh conditions could help us explore other planets, like Mars or even some exoplanets. The challenges associated with exploring Venus could lead to new breakthroughs and innovations in space exploration technology.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case for studying Venus despite the risks it presents. By highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument that exploring Venus could help us better understand our own planet and improve space technology. While there are certainly many challenges that would need to be overcome, the potential benefits of exploring Venus are worth the risk. Therefore, it is worth pursuing further exploration of Venus.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for both individuals and society. Our overreliance on private vehicles has detrimental environmental, health, and economic consequences that can be reduced by driving less. 

Climate change poses one of the greatest threats facing humanity. Transportation accounts for nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in developed nations like the United States. (Source 1) By driving less and choosing alternative modes of transportation more often, such as public transit, biking, or walking, individuals can significantly lower their carbon footprint. Even small changes like working from home one day a week or carpooling can collectively make a huge difference in curbing emissions. With climate impacts already visible around the world, limiting car usage is one practical action individuals can take to help address this crisis.

In addition to environmental impacts, excessive driving negatively affects public health. Automobile emissions release pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides that are linked to respiratory illnesses like asthma, especially among children. (Source 2) Less driving means fewer harmful emissions near homes and schools. Physical inactivity is also a major public health problem, but active transportation methods get people moving in a low-impact way. Biking or walk even short distances daily provides significant health benefits. By choosing alternatives to solo driving when possible, individuals can improve lung health and lower disease risks through increased exercise. 

Economically, reduced car dependency yields savings at both personal and societal levels. Owning and maintaining a private vehicle is costly, with expenses like car payments, insurance, gas and repairs. (Source 3) Individuals who drive less by using alternate modes even just a few days a week can save hundreds of dollars annually. That money can be put to better use elsewhere. At a system-wide level, limiting car usage eases traffic congestion and road repairs, saving on infrastructure costs. With financial and natural resources better spent on more essential needs, limiting personal vehicles provides clear economic advantages.

In conclusion, our overreliance on cars carries serious environmental, public health and economic consequences. While driving will always have important uses, limiting unnecessary solo trips and choosing alternatives even occasionally can yield wide-ranging societal benefits. Small reductions in car usage multiplied across many individuals could significantly improve sustainability, health and cost efficiency if prioritized as one part of an overall strategy.",1
"Limiting Car Usage for a Greener Future

As cities grow larger, traffic congestion and pollution have become serious issues affecting public health and the environment. While cars provide convenient transportation, overreliance on personal vehicles comes at significant costs. By limiting unnecessary car trips and promoting alternative modes of transit, communities can work towards a more sustainable future. 

There are several benefits to restricting car usage. Firstly, it can improve air quality and reduce health impacts. Emissions from automobile exhaust contain various pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides that are linked to respiratory illnesses. Cutting back on driving lowers the amounts of these harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere. With fewer vehicles on the road, neighborhoods experience less air pollution. This especially helps vulnerable groups such as children, elderly and those with existing lung or heart conditions.

In addition, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion on busy roads. Rush hour gridlock wastes people's time and fuels. It also increases vehicle emissions as cars burn more gas while idling or moving slowly. Some cities have seen travel times reduced by over 20% after implementing policies that discouraged commuting by private car. With less congestion, public transit is able to move more efficiently as well. This makes alternative transportation options more reliable and attractive. 

Encouraging alternative modes of transit brings further benefits. Walking and cycling improve public health by encouraging an active lifestyle. Biking or walking even short distances on a regular basis can significantly boost physical fitness. These low-carbon options also don't contribute to noise or air pollution at congested urban areas. Public transportation is another greener alternative to personal vehicles as multiple people can share the same bus or train trip. A robust transit network with good connectivity and frequency of service helps reduce dependence on automobiles.

In conclusion, limiting unnecessary car trips would lead to tangible environmental and public health advantages. By prioritizing efficient modes of travel over personal vehicles, communities can enjoy cleaner air, less traffic and a more sustainable long-term future. Stronger policies are needed to change individual transportation habits and support viable alternatives to driving. A multi-pronged approach considering all mobility options can help balance transportation needs with environmental protection goals.",1
