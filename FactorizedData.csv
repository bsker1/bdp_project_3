0,"To the author, the limitations that exploring venus brings, should not be enough to kill the curiosity that many of us have. Although it has been a long time since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus, the author believes that with the technology and willpower we have today, Venus could be explored.

The author keeps referring to Venus as earth's twin. this could show that the author is trying to get across that this planet is not much different from ours. This technique can help pursuade people into believing that it is beyond possible to touch down on Venus. The author writes about alot of the reasons why we could go to Venus, but makes sure to touch on the challenges people may face and the limitations. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" These limitations stated in paragraph 3 of the article are just some of the challenges associated with exploring Venus.

The author believes even with all of the limitations, studying Venus could have so many benefits in the future. But another limitation is that hovering Venus at a safe distance might not give the insight on the conditions that people may need. Although he seems to be focusing on the negatives of it all, he brings in light to work around the limits. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for weeks in such conditions."" Here the author is bringing in the positives which ultimately outweigh the negatives. The limitations seemed to revolve around the harsh conditions, but the author introducing this peice of technology that would work around it helps support the authors ideas.

To conclude, the author has many doubts and fears about studying Venus, but remembers to tell about ways to work around the natural challenges the people would face. The authors idea that claims that studying venus is more important than the dangers pursuades many people into believing that as well. Finally, the author does a great job getting his point across.",0,399
1,"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winnertakeall system in each state. This means candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winnertakeall system, smaller states don't get the same opportunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid runoff elections. Runoff elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winnertakeall basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best.",0,852
2,"Dear Florida Senator, The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Source 1 However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Some state laws vary Source 1 If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""Source 3 In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" Source 3 you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source 2 If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" Source 2 In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. Source 2 The Electoral College also follows the ""Winnertakeall"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College Source 3 what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.",0,578
3,"Luke joined the seagoing cowboys because he wanted to be helpful. but here is the thing no one else from his town joined probibley because they were to scared to even think about even doing the job i cant believ he was the only one to join that is just not right. so some one else needs to join. but no one will join at all so he is the only one to do the job and if i were him i would be so mad i would just quite.

one reason why people should join because they would go tho diffrent places and meet diffrent people and try diffrent food because in the story it says that Luke went to CHINA and gave tem mules horses and cows because some people eat cow and the also ride the horse and mule but they also use them to transeport goods and to till the filde.

4,"Driveless cars sound really cool and up to date to many people. People would think they wouldnt have to pay any attention to their surrondings, the road, or have any sense as to where they are going. These driving cars are developed to have vibrating drivers seats when the vehicle is in danger and the car has absolutley no control over itself no matter how dangerous the situation is. The driver himself would have to do everything he could to get the car in control and to avoid the incident as soon as possible. So why would even get a driveless car if you have to take control every once in a while? Driving cars sound pretty dangerous and could possibly put you in an accident.

When you hear about driveless cars, you'd really like to think you dont have to do much of anything since the car is in control itself and you have all this time to relax. Wrong. The driver DOES have to take immediate control when the car is in danger, (could be of backing into an object etc.), navigating through work zones, and having to work your way around accidents.

""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph."" Only 25 mph. How come these things can't handle being on the highway or interstate? The driverless car sounds usless and it's another excuss for people to be lazy. Actually, couldn't you lose braincells if not paying full attention to what you're doing in the car/on the road? Maybe not lose braincells but in a way this driverless car could possibly mess you up in a way mentally because in that moment you dont have a care in the world and thing you don't need to pay attention to what's going on around you inside the car. It could maybe make you lose hope for yourself because now you can depend on something else to do something for you even though you're still in the use of danger inside a driverless car. Manufacturers are wasting their time.",0,344
5,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",0,428
6,"For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars (source 4). More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, Bogata, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limitted use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.

We use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too convienant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them (source 1). I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a neccesity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace (source 1). It's almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most car-owners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier (source 1). Carlos Arturo Plaza, in Bogata, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual no-car day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental well-being. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants (source 4). Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days (source 2). Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a neccesity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey."" (source 4).",0,760
7,"Have you ever looked in a telescope and seen the Face on Mars? Many people believe the The Face on Mars was created by aliens, but it is a natural landform. The Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL website showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it.

First, on April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Face for the first time. ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" (7) When a JPL website revealed the photo many anxious waiters were astounished that the Cydonia was a natural landform.

Secondly,

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, confirmed the Face was a of a butte or mesa. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, (12) Mr. Garvin also claimed Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. (12) Which means that the Face on Mars is very similar to a lave dome, butte, or mesa.

Next, if there was an ancient civilization on Mars and they made the Face then NASA would benefit from it. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (5) This quote is explaining that if NASA knew there was an ancient civilization on Mars then they would benefit from the civilization. Why would NASA keep an ancient civilization on Mars a secret if they could benefit from the situation?

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL web site showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it. Now do you believe the Face on Mars was created by aliens?",0,371
8,"The Face...something conspiarcy theorist have gripped on for forty years. It is just a rock with shadows, NASA uses a camera so good that it is possible to see an airplane from it, and if it was an alien construction NASA would publicize it just to be able to get more funds for the space program. Come on people, you have got to get over the possibility of life on mars, we have been searching for forty years now.

First thing is, it is just a mesa on Mars. The shadows on it and the concaves give off the optical illusion that it is a face. There is no life on Mars, therefore there is no way it could be artificial. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their moniters. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cynodia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."" (P. 2) This shows that no matter how people wanted to believe, there was just not life on Mars.

NASA's camera spanned 1. 56 meters in 2001. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gorund or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" (P. 11) This excerpt shows that with a camera as such a high grade as this one that there was barely anyhting on Mars surface that could be hidden.

While there is the smallest chance of the consiracy theorist being correct about the structure being artificially constructed and such, NASA would let this out. Let's go ahead and assume the theorist are correct. Spot on. NASA has been cut off by the government and has to pay for all of their journeys. NASA would bring this to the public in the hopes of getting funds and people wanting to work there for the future that could be. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (P. 5) This quote shows that NASA would quite appreciate the civilization on Mars, if there was any.

People have got to get over the possibility of life on Mars, even if it was there it is probably as small as bacteria this moment. This hump of dirt and rocks is not a face, NASA's cameras are so enhanced we would see signs of artificial construction, and NASA would tell us that way they could get their hands on some money. Come on guys, it's been forty years, give it a rest.",0,465
9,"Everyone wants to go to the park with their children or grandchildren, or maybe just take a nice walk. With the way we live now everything will be too polluted because alot of people drive cars and dont take the bus,walk, or carpool. Yes, people should limit their car usage. They should limit their uses because owning a car is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public transportation, and it reduces smogpollution.

Owning a car is more expensive then you think. In a city such as Vauban in Germany that has only two places to park, a large parking garage, and a develment where the car owner needs to buy the spot for forty thousand dollars along with a home. In places like Bogota, Columbia on their national car free day all violaters will be fined twentyfive dollars. It may not seem like alot, but it all adds up at the end of the day. In places like Paris motorist with even numbered license plates receive a twentytwo euro fine 31, and the following day motorist with odd numbered plates received the same fine. Almost four thousand drivers were fined. those are just instances where fines have occurred, other expenses are gas. Some people who are wealthy and have money won't be impacted by this the same way an average family with three children will.

Most people take public transportation for granted. Imagine if we didn't have busses, trains, and subways. Imagine having to drive to New York City instead of the subway. It is not a pretty thought. In places like Bogota, Columbia that has a national day without cars people use public transportation or walk, unless they want a twentyfive dollar fine. According to Mayor Antanas Mockus "" The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" Cities such as Cali and Valledupar have also done what Bogota has done, and Municipal authorities from other countries came to see the turnout, and they were enthusiastic. New York is promoting a bike sharing program that allows people to ride bikes through the city and return them at any location. ""me. Sivaks's son lives in San Francisco and has a car, but takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit when he can even though it often takes longer then driving."" Even though some people don't take public transportation beacuse they are too cool for it, they might just need to in order to save the place they live.

Have you ever wondered why you can hardly see the stars at night? It's not because they aren't there, but it is beacuse the smoke from the pollution and smog is covering the view. After days of nearrecord pollution Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of all the polution. Congestion of the smog only went down sixty percent in five days. The reason was of diesel fuel which is more used because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Places like Bogota, Columbia who have a day without cars have a day for pollution and smog to be reduced, and places like Vauban, Germany who only have cars on the main thoroughfare virtually have no smog or pollution beacuse they don't allow cars in homes. Even though it's a hassle to change everything to do it, but by just doing one thing a time they are helping the enviroment.

Now that we see and know that the people of Vauban, Germany live with no cars, and the people of Bogota, Columbia have a day with no cars. those places don't have as much pollution such as Paris who had to ban driving so they can reduce pollution. We know that in Vauban you can park the car for forty thousand dolalrs, or get fined for driving on the one day you are asked not to. All thoose reasons only promotes public transportation or walking. So yes, people should limit there use of cars because it is expensive, it promotes the use of walking and public transportation, and it reduces smogpollution.",0,675
10,"Dear fellow citezens of America it has come to my attention that pollution in the United States is getting worse so I have a solution use cars less. It is simple, this will help cut pollution in the U.S as the second biggest polluting factor is gone and can actually help you with a better social life as well as helping rebuild the community.

As mentioned earlier,cars are the second leading cause of pollution in the U.S and cutting that will help stop some pollution by stopping one of the biigest causes. Stopping the use of cars will cut the carbon in the air and this in turn can lead to a healthier lifestyle as well. There are many neighborhoods that are car-less and we have recieved good results from said neighborhoods as well as car free day is becoming a hit in Columbia as well as other parts in central America. This will also make smog a less likely occurence as no car fumes are getting trapped therefore, cleaner, unpolluted air. This will help prevent the same pollution levels like in Paris pop up here.

A life without cars can also posotivly affect the social lives of many people. As people are more likely to just walk and talk with freinds or just walk or bike to the park. people in car-less communitys like Vauban have even said they feel less stress now that they don't have cars. Young Americans have even started loseing intrests in cars and would rather take public transport or carpool with freinds then just take their own car. And as a result are tighter with their freinds and family then before.

People who use cars for transport are less likely to use the sidewalk or ride their bike and as a result sidewalks and bike paths are uneven and ragged.  Therefore without cars, things like disrepaired sidewalks or roads would come to our attention. For example Car Free Day in Columbia led to the repair of sidewalks and 118 miles of bike roads and more sport centers parks and shopping districts have started to pop up. Getting rid of cars can help us rebuild the community with more parks and public centers and hangouts. This will also lead to better security as less people will get hit by cars, less car accidents and overall better security.

In conclusion my fellow citezens, please consider makeing this community car-less. for their are many advantages for doing so in this community from the enviromental, to the social and to the health benefits.",0,425
11,"In the passage, many examples were given why Venus is so dangerous to study. Even though the neighboring planet may very dangerous to study, the author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit by describing the reasons why scientists would want to study the planet, and the different ideas that were created to help scientists gain more information.

The author has given many examples of how Earth and Venus are alike. In paragraph 4, it stated, ¨Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported carious forms of life, just like Earth.¨ Scientists would want to study Venus because there may be forms of life on Venus that no one might know about. The paragraph also stated, ¨Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ Not only does Venus may have different forms of life, but the planet also has features that planet Earth has as well. Scientist would want to study more to see how those formed and how that might lead into more information about the planet. Paragraph 4 also mentioned, ¨Futhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frams of space travel.¨ During different times, Mars and Venus can be closer to Earth. Scientists are already studying Mars, and with Venus being so close, they would also want to study it too. For the planet being so close, it would not take that much time to travel.

The author of the excerpt has also given information of how the scientists could reach their destination, Venus. In paragraph 5, it said, ¨NASA´s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hover Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.¨ This is an idea of how scientists could study Venus. The author also compared the technology that people have down on earth can help create a solution to get up in space to study. With hovering over the planet, temperatures would ¨still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit¨ as stated in paragraph 5, the pressure would not be as bad. The pressure ¨would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Even though the conditions are still not that great, the survival rate of humans going to Venus would be higher.

The author also gave other examples of how people can study Venus. In paragraph 7, it said, ¨NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus´s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ The author of the excerpt is explaining that NASA has tested an idea that may work out for research of the planet due to the conditions. With the silicon carbide electronics, they may be able to help gather information without burning up right when it reaches to Venus. The paragraph also mentioned, ¨Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers.¨ The reason that they would use old technology because it deals with older materials, levers and gears. Modern technology would be more delicate in space. The author also mentioned, ¨By comparison, systems that use machanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.¨ The author explained why using older technology would help with the other project the scientists are working on rather than using modern technology.

With the challenges of the pressure, heat, and other factors that Venus has, the planet is still worth studying. The author have put it into perspective that even though things may be challenging, there are ways to accomplish what the people want. By explaining how Venus is compared to Earth, it will put more determination of gathering information about Venus that no one has figured out before. The different ideas of how people can get up to Venus is another way to present why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it has. With the dangerous factors that scientists face with Venus, it is still a planet in the sky that is worth studying.",0,765

Therefor this is a reason why scientist love to study Venus it just like Earth but without any humans on the planet and it could be an option for a next planet vist.

""Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendy ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivabe for humans."" So since Venus is like kind of sutable for humans it could be a new Earth in cse if something happen on Earth like a radioactive wave that could kill anybody we can go to Venus and live there dispite the harsh temepature and landing, it has a lot of similaritys of Earth.

Overall Venus is a good planet for living things to live on and good thing for scientist to study over Venus to get some good and bad and theres obaviously bad side of Venus but scientist and many other researchers are trying there best to make a perfect world incase somethng does hapen in the future and we have to evacuate Earth.",0,335
13,"I think that people should be able  to use there own car when they to for there to get around aleats lower gas prices so people want be in there cars much as they u to be. Some people need to use there cars for the onlu way for transpartion to get doctors and dentisis appoinments they can also use there cars less because there wasting valuable resources in world because gas makes the car so that a valuavble resources we need to keep so maybe if people stay out thers cars it will make the gases prices go down they you can use for only if really need if you the car as a emgercy.

Why are there no cars on Vaubans street but expect there are only a few down town in but thats only if you are ride the tram to get around. I think every state should have a trams and bus and bullets trains to get them to one  to another that would totally cut out the numbers of cars you will see on the so why not consider trying a new idea to get cars off the road maybe invent something that will occupie peoples so they want have to you there cars to get around I am try it and see though it might be good thing to do.

Why do people by more than one car its only one of them and mulitiply cars so why waste money more than one car when you can sell your for things that are important like paying a bill or get gorcery for you house or just helping otherss out so i thing that dumb for peole to have more than one car if you are not going to use the cars all time I understand that celebrites haves mulitiply cars because they show them but the car usage is still high but people can do what evere they want with there money who I am just a boy i coming telling you people with more than car is really really ricdulious to but hey I am going sit back and let people use up there gas in there so be it.",0,367
14,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future.

With as many companies working towards driverless cars: Google, Toyota, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, I think we'll have streets full of the in no time.

I think driverless cars are a fantastic idea.

Humans have flaws, and machines do too, but if we could manufacture a car smart enough to know how to navigate in traffic on its own, and when and where to stop a humans flaws would not be an issue.

We have too many distractions in our lives, and needless to say we're thinking about those things while we're driving.

""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" -paragraph 5.

This indicates that driverless cars are safer than manual ones, and that they use less energy.

With cars as sensitive as these, there would be fewer accidents as well.

There are a few issues with the case: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" -paragraph 9.

On the other hand, by the time driverless cars are on the streets we should have most legal issues worked out.

All in all, I think self-driving cars are safer than manual ones.

With as many distractions as we have in our lives, we really do not need another thing to be worrying about.",0,277
15,"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usuage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usuage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advangtages such as reducing pollutin, increasing saftety for human beings, and even opeing options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of polluants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with Heidurn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vechicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay $40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined $31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public annocement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleanier. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vechicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases saftety, bumping into another human or being nugded by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advangtages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0,596
16,"In ""The Challenge of Eploring Venus,"" the author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy planet for exploration. Even though it is very dangerous to explore he/she explains how Venus might be one of the planets humans will want to vist because it could hold secrets to our planets birth and death. Then they tell in full detail how we could possibly vist Venus safely. These few key details help the author build and support the suggested idea that we should vist Venus.

First we must know that going to Venus will not be easy for humans to do. In the text the author writes,""A thick Atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highy corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This further proves that Venus is going to be a serious challenge for man kind to vist because of the crazy condtions humans will have to face.

In order to vist venus safely we need to be able to plan a way to survive Venus's extreme conditions. In the text the author provides examples of how humans will do so such as,""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our Jet airplains travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way."" This futher proves that traveling to Venus in the furture is possible. Also that scientists are coming up with ways on how we can safely get to Venus's surface.

Most importantly Venus could help us understnad more about space. In the text the author writes,""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further vists to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This point further proves that Venus is a place humans should want to explore because it could hold answers for Earths begginings and how it might end. Also Venus could hold secrets about our universes beggining and end.

In concusion the author proves that Venus should be further investigated because even though it faces many dangers it is possible to vist. Also visting Venus could give humans valuble information on our planets life as well as unlock keys to how our universe could have begun and is going to end. The author does more than an perfect job at telling why humans should go to Venus.",0,487
17,"Take a step outside and a second to look around? Now tell me what you see ? The trees and grass green, the beautiful clear white clouds up in the sky, the birds chripping and flying, wandering and looking for something to eat. You see life. All it takes is a snap of a finger and all of that would go away. All the trees ugly and destory, the grass would no longer be green and the clouds all dark and upset , You wouldn't see life anymore you would see depression. This could all happen if we keep harming the envoirnment by using cars and polluting the air by all the trucks that has been driven around. We need to stop before things get worst. There are benefits and advantage of limiting car usage.

Residents in Vauban, Germany are limiting car usage they're using bikes and most of them enjoy the walk. Most passgeners don't know that their cars and them are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States vary up to 50 percent. You wouldn't want to be blame for such an act. As a matter of Heidrun Walter commented ,in Source 1: ""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""

If she feels like this ,there is no doubt that everyone wouldn't feel the same. If you're stress and unhappy than take a walk, Mrs. Walter walked the verdant streets where the bicycles swish and chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distan motor. The whole point of a car is getting from point A to point B and many people are concern about the fact that they won't have any tranportation , this statement is false. Vauban has a home to 5,500 residents and they're trying to built houses where stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Lets take a look at Paris, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If people didn't follow this enforcement they suffer a 22-euro fine of ($31). This act cause congestion meaning car traffic wemt down 60 percent in the captial of France that would mean not cause more damage to the envoirnment. This is also good because looking at their histroy diesel fuel was blamed and france has . . . [a] tax policy . . . diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a53.3 percent. .  .

There is no excuse for not being able to use a car. Look at the benefit you can hike, bike, skate and take buses. There are working on a new car progam isn't going to harm the enviornment, and plus this is a great opportunity to take away stress and also lower air pollution. There is also other wys to get transportaiont there is car-pooling. The internet also pay a big part because it makes it possible to allow people to feel more connected without driving to meet and chat with friends.",0,522
18,"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessarry places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert Duffer's article

Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost

HALF

of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that ""

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,

after five days of intensifying smog.""

The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, ""

Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.""

This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.",0,516
19,"Dear Senator,

This is a fabulous and very plentiful country. We the people are grateful of our freedom and love our leaders. However, our system of choosing our leaders is not the best. The Electoral College is unreliable and not very accurate. We should vote by most popular choice among the citizens of America.

The electoral voting system is not very efficient because, mostly by this in my opinion, each state really has only 1 vote. A represenative worth 55 million people should not be equal to a represenative worth only 500,000 people. This system is very unbalanced and unfair to the American people. Canidates for the election only have to focus on certain states that they can swing in their favor and get most of the states votes, but they won't always be getting most of the peoples votes.

An election where each citizen counts as 1 vote and out of all those votes the majority wins. That is a more than fair system of voting, not some system where we vote for someone to vote for us. That's just flat out unethical, unfair, and unwanted.",0,187

21,"The face on Mars could have not been by alien's because there was no alien monument at all. It is a rare thing to see something like that on a planet that has a lot of rumors of aliens. Yet you can still say or predict this wasn't an alien act.

After we saw the face on Mars we had to get more pictures of it. That might not change your mind, and you still might think it was an act of alien's ,but check this out. In paragraph 3 it says that it was a huge rock formation. It resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This could possibly mean that it's the angle you are looking at it. If you were looking at the ""head"" from a diffrent angle it would probably not even look like a head anymore. This is a reason why it could not have been from aliens.

In paragraph 2 it says that when the face appeared on their monitors they were surprised. Even though the sensation was short lived, scientist figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. You may be asking, ""Why dont you target Cydonia?'. The answer is it's hard work. In fact its very difficult work. The reason we don't target Cydonia is because, ""We don't pass over the face very often,"" says Garvin in paragraph 9.

On April 8, 2001 a nice day in Cydonia We finally got a second look at it. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. They captured another photo finally with one of their best camera's.

Now you are probably asking yourself what does this have to do with aliens. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Meaning that it wasn't an alien act. It was a huge rock formation.",0,342
22,"Every day, we all wake up and instantly start to calculate how the day will most likely go. Much of this calculation revolves around the people that surround us constantly, like our family and our friends, who have the most impact on our behaviors and moods. We take a quick look at their faces and their body language, and can make a pretty close assumption as to what that person is feeling, what thoughts they are having, and how they will feed off of other people's moods as well. It's pretty easy to decipher many of these things without a problem, but sometimes, especially when an emotion is mixed, it's a little harder to calculate. Now, technology has been formed to help us find out what others are really feeling, even if they are hiding it. In many situations, this software could be useful. Some settings, not so much.

In a public schooling atmosphere, mood is pretty much what makes or breaks how a class will go. If the students are sad or the teacher is moody, the class might be that much more of burden to deal with all the negativity. If a class is particularly boring, and the students are tired, the class might go on for ages. Plus, some material might be confusing for some students, and this will make the class much harder as well to understand and pass. As people, we tend to subconsiously figure out this kind of information as soon as possible, in order to better guess how they should behave. We do it so often, we as a people have gotten pretty good at this. So how useful would this technoogy be in this particular situation? Not very, since in a clasroom setting it is fairly easy to tell when a student is confused or bored. Now, there are other situations, some even still withing the guidelines of 'school', in which this technology would be used more often.

Online schooling is an ever-growing web of ideas and people, and is almost always a good experience to have even if they dont stick with it. However, the social aspect of school is forgotten as well as the face-to-face contact with teachers that is useful in situations like confusion, boredness, or even sickness. This technology would be especially useful for this type of setting, since it can give teachers an insight on what their students are feeling about the material that they are teaching. It can help them shape their curriculum to better fit that student's needs, and therefore give a better and long-lasting impact on that student's grades, and possibly even future. It could be an integrated part of the website or a type of software that is highly reccomended or required to download. Even aside from all of that, there are even more uses for this software outside of the school setting.

In therapy sessions, or even interrogations, this kind of technology could be even more useful. In therapy, the people that go have most likely gotten very good at concealing their emotions, and doing things like fake smiling. This kind of technology could help the therapist better understand when something like this happens, and therefore help the patient get better faster, and to a higher degree. Interrogations, often done to help gain information that the prisoner most liekly does not wish to give. This technology could better read the facial expressions in details that we normally cannot decipher ourselves, and therefore better know when a person is lying or witholding information, and also help people know when they gave all the info they know.

A public school setting is most likely not the best way to use this programming, especially since it has so many other incredibly helpful uses that would be much more beneficial to many things. Its obvious when someone is happy, excited, overly sad, or losing their temper. bot expressions like boredness, disgust, fear, and pride are hard to figure in small doses. This new technology will be used in a variety of ways, but how many of those will actually we beneficial?",0,685
23,"A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous. Even though it is dangerous, the author makes a valid point, NASA should be determined to research Venus since the discoveries made there can possibly give insight on what Earth may become.

Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere. All of these facts are provide the possibility of being able to make human contact on Venus. Not only would that allow scientist to further research what Earth may become, but if humans are able to reside on another planet, it would greatly help rid overcrowding and Venus may be a future inhabitable location for humans.

Obviously, the idea of sending humans to Venus far excedes our current technology, but traveling to that planet may be the future of humanity. The author states that the value of returning to Venus is indesputable, yet horribly dangerous. Danger should not put off scientists into further discovering that planet, but rather it should encourage them to work even harder in order to someday provide a safe passage between Earth and Venus. This would be beneficial to human society, because it could potentially help rid future problems of overpopulation and even provide insight on what Earth may become. This all leads to concluding that the author made a most valid statement and provides evidence that provides wonderful reasoning as to why scientists should explore Venus and the benefits the exploration would provide.",0,449

The planet is strangly reffered to ""Earth's twin"", today it might not hold Earth's qualities, but long ago it was beilieved it did. Scientist's are set to beileve that at one point Venus had oceans and a possinble life sorce. A time before the extreme weather conditions, Venus is said to have flourished with oceans, supporting various forms of life, like Earth today. Now, that is long gone, taken over by a volcanic terrain. Exploring Venus will be dangerous and worth all the odds against it.

We, as humans, have already tried to explore the dangerous planet before. Each mission has been unmanned as no spacecraft has even survived the landing for more than a few hours. Nasa is now working on other approaches to studying Venus. One project being conducted states ""having simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" That will allow us to have a better understanding of limiting the exteme factors. Looking back to mechanial computers, will be easiter as it is more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Exploration of Venus would contribute emensally to our knowlendge of our sister planet. The author states ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors."" Through our curiosity, it will allow us to aquire insight into a new vast world, far beyond our exploration on Earth.

25,"25 years ago ""The Face"" happend on Mars. Some people say The Face on Mars came from aliens, the face is a very known figure , that NASA discovered. It was found out that there was no aliens that created this object, but came natural.

In fact on Apirl 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, after the Viking discovered the face over 22 years ago on 1976, Michael Milan and His Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a photo ten times sharper than the oringial Viking photos , witch revelaved a natural landform, as said by the Mars Global Surveyor team.

Some people were not convinced that the face was a natural landform , due to there being haze, winds and also a cloudy time to see the face through the camera, there were conspriacy theorists that said ""Perhaps skeptic and alien markings were hidden by the haze.""

But then on April 8 , 2001 almost 3 years later - a cloudless summer day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close to the ""Face on Mars"" they had to ""roll 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view"" said Gravin. Malins team captured a extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution, each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo to finally prove that ""The Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, Still to this day there are conspiracy theorist who believe that ""The Face on Mars"" was not a natrual making!",0,259
26,"The author states at the very end of the passage, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". That is powerful. He is explaining that just because we do stuff here on Earth, or just because we find something out does not mean that we stop there. It means we strive and conquer our mission to do more, and here's why.

The scientists want samples, however, that would be very risky. Despite the risks, scientists would have to get up close and personal with Venus. They personally know that there are a lot of risks getting close to Venus. They mentioned that it could melt a spacecraft in a matter of a couple hours. However, they are determined. The author mentioned Venus had a lot of ""value"", he also stated, ""not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This has meaning, and what it means is that not only do the scientists want to know about Venus and their ideas may lead to exploring Venus , but human curiosity will also take over and other people will want to know about Venus as well.

In conclusion, Scientists want to know and explore Venus, and normal people are going to want to understand and learn about Venus as well. The scientists need this information to further the progression of learning and experimenting with Venus. They are probably going to do whatever it takes to learn about Venus, despite the dangers and fatal risks of going there. They will more than likely one day get there, but there will probably be a lot of trial and error along the way.",0,306

We will never know because we cant see things that never happened. And isnt the Electoral College a lot eaiser then an election by the popluar vote? So why change it now?

28,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about Earth's sister planet and the chaotic environment it hosts. They also mention that for years, scientists have been trying to discover ways that this planet may be hospitable or of good use to humans. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the risks and dangers because evidence shows that it has features much like Earth, and could sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit.

Geographical features show that at one time, Venus was likely covered with oceans and could have supported life. The author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (4). This shows that while conditions on Venus may be particularly brutal, there is a high chance it was once a habitable land like Earth.

Though there are certainly high risks that come with traveling to such a dangerous planet, there are ways for humans to survive them. The author mentions that, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. ... the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"" (5). With humans' current technological advances, it is made possible to avoid the worst of the cruel conditions on Venus, like sweltering heat and impossible atmospheric pressure.

In conclusion, there is a lot to look at for both sides of this topic. The author does a good job with addressing the issues that come with sending space crafts and people to Venus, while also talking through the ways some complications might be avoided.",0,317
29,"Have you ever dreamed of driverless cars in the future as a child? Well if you have, that dream seems to be coming true. Companies have said that driverless cars are completely safe, but would you be able to trust that? The thought of driverless car may seem absolutely wonderful, but the dangers that come with it may not. Driverless cars shouldn't be allowed on the roads because they are not completely driverless, driving laws may change, and we need smarter roads.

According to the article, it says that ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car can handle driving functions at sppeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel and the driver must remain alert"". If the driver still needs to hold on to the wheel, then why are they called driverless cars? This can be very dangerous because the driver may not be fully alert to take over. Something may go wrong to where the driverless car doesn't alert the driver to take over in time which could lead to a serious accident.

According to the article, it says the ""Driving laws mainly written on having a human driver controlling the car at all times."" Driving laws focus on keeping driver, passangers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is fully achieved with alert driver. If the driver isn't alert than that could cause lives to be in danger. Driving laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times, not having a human driver drive only for a certain amount of time and the car driving itself. Traffic laws would have to change in order to cover the liability in case of an accident.

According to the article, it says that ""Smarter roads are too expensive to be pratical"". If there is a smarter car on the road, we will need to have smarter roads and that comes with a lot of work. Smart-road systems work suprisingly well, but they require massive upgrading to exsisting roads. For starters, the driverless car will need to have an excessive amount of sensors. That causes the car to need a lot of improving in order to function with exsisting roads.

Driverless cars has its perks, but it has many downsides also. Driverless cars could form a public transportation system where people all over the world could use. While that may seem amazing, the dangers of having cars drive themselves overtakes that because driverless cars are not completely driverless, traffic laws may change, and we need smarter roads. The safety of driverless cars may change, but however, we need to wait for what the future holds for us.",0,462
30,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program!

You can help people and animals recover their food supply. You also have time to look around at places you've never seen before.

Like Luke, he says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable oppotunity."" Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice,

Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. If you were to be a Seagoing Cowboy, you could have all these benefits too.

On return trips you can have fun by playing some games, like baseball and volleyball games. They also played Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

It can be a great adventure for you, but it can also open up the world to you just like it did for Luke. It changed Luke's life, and it can change your life too.",0,158
31,"Abolishing the Electoral College may be the best choice because the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecetoral college. Also at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

If a tie occurs the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Because of many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, The House's selection can hardly reflect the will of the people. For exapmple a tie would have occured in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii had voted the other way.

The electoral college can be unfair to voters because the winner-take-all syntem in each state, candidates fon't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The elctoral college can have many good things but it still is not good enough for us to keep it. If the winner-tak-all systm didn't exist candidates would spend time in states even if they know they have no chance of winning, because they will not lose anything or maybe have at least a liitle chance of winning.",0,261
32,"Residents in Vauban, Germany have done the unthinkable; they have given up their cars. It's streets are completely car-free. You can still own a car, but the problem is their is only two places to park: large garages at the edge of the development and where a car-owner buys a garage with a home.

Automobiles in France were to have caused a near-record pollution in paris. Diesel fuel was blamed. In paragraph 16 it says ""Diesel fuel makes up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3% average in the rest of Western Europe.""

In Bogota, Columbia only buses and taxis were permitted for the day without cars. The goal for this capital city was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In paragraph 28 it says ""Parks and sports cemters also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Research has shown that citizens in the United States are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. In paragraph 32 it says ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" In paragraph 43 it says ""Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, coserve resources, lower emmisions, and improve safety.""",0,277
33,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Some people say that we should have facial recognition in the computers in schools so that if the student looks bored or confused, the computer will change it up a little bit for their liking. It will also be able to help teachers know when a student needs assistance or needs a more energizing lesson. Using this technology in classrooms is valuable because it will help teachers change their actions and might help the student become more engaged.

Schools all over the world would really benefit from the Facial Action Coding System. By using this, there could be a possibility of more engaged students and finally result in higher test scores. Dr. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Not only will teachers result from this, but students will as well. Just by using the computer system, we will be able to tell how a student is feeling in that classroom or during a certain lesson. If we could see the facial expression, be able to figure out why, and change something to fix it, that would be very effective in the school setting.

Although this would be really great, many people could say that not all students have the same feelings about things so if a teacher changed his or her lesson based on one student, then some of the other students might not be as engaged or delighted. It wouldn't be right to do something based on one student rather than twenty-five. If a few students are very engaged in this lesson and they are paying attention and getting something out of it but other students are confused, if the teacher decides to make a change for the confused students, the students that were engaged in the lesson may become unengaged or bored. That would be the downfall of using this sort of technology.

A very appropriate setting for the Facial Action Coding System would be online schooling and home schooling because both of those are mainly based on the one student taking that course or class. If the camera on the computer sent a signal to the online schooler or home schooler, it would be easy to make a change in the lesson to try and get the student more engaged. Having a student pay more attention and be more engaged in a lesson could actually help raise test scores because if someone was doing something that was actually fun and they could actually retain the knowledge, it might be effective.

Using the Facial Action Coding system in classrooms is valuable and effective. It will help students become more engaged and pay more attention. It will also help raise test scores at least partially because they will be able to remember what they learned when it was something that they liked. While some might have contradictory thoughts, it is mostly a valuable piece of technology that should be used in many schools across the world.",0,517

My first reason why we should have a limit to using our cars are because so we dont waste alot of our fossil fuerol. we go through tons and tons of fossil fuel. It's getting to the point were we might even  run out of it and wont have it anymore and wont be able to make gas and trust me we use gas for just about everything!

My second reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is so  we dont produce alot of polution. we produce tons and tons of polution every single time we drive our cars and thats very bad cause it polutes our air and it not good for us to breath it in!

My last reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is cause it will vsave us tons of money! i mean keep count everyday how much you pay for gas and at the end of the week add thewm all together and see how much you waste on gas each weeek. also what if your tiers are no good nomore just for a set of 4 its going to bcome up to like $200 dolars !And then what is you need new light or new windshield wipers. ust think how much money you put in to your car. if i were you i would just start walking or rideing a bike!

35,"Student emotions can sometimes be hard to read. Students experience many different emotions everday throughout school. Some students may be happy and excited about school while others are bored and drowsy. New technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to indentify human emotions. This technology would be very benefiticial to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

With this new tech teachers would have the ability to read there students emotional expressions when they are giving a lesson. If the students emotional responses are boredom and drowsiness. Then the teacher will know they should change what they are doing so the students become more alert and interested.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. If a student is becoming lost or dosent understand the material the computer will recognize that and the teacher will be able to stop and help that student.

The use of this tech will allow teaching in the classroom to become more efficent and if a student is struggling teachers will be able to recognize that quicker. This system will not only help with teaching but can also help emotionally. If a student is sad and going through some difficult things the computer can recognize this by the students facial expressions. The teacher then can talk to the sutdent and maybe cheer them up.

This technology can also help with school safety. Recently there have been alot of school shootings and threats. If a student has a look on their face that shows anger,sadness,intent,or rage. The computer will recognize this and the teacher may be able to prevent anything bad from happening to that student or other people in general.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in many different ways. It can make teaching more efficent. It can help teachers identify students who are lost or confused. It can recognize when a student is sad,mad,or angry therefore allowing the teacher the opportunity to speak with that student and see if they are ok.",0,357
36,"Can you always tell if a student is happy or sad by the way he/she looks? With the new technology invention, we can totally see if a student is happy/sad. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a class room. it can recognize emotions, it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and lastly, it can create emotional communication.

First, the system can recognize emotions. It is not always possible for teachers to make correct assumptions on how the students are feeling. For instance, if someone finds out about how a student is feeling, he/she will have ""Some trouble describing each facial trait that conveys, happy, worried."" With the use of the facial action code in a classroom, a teacher can precisely tell how a students is feeling. According to Dr. Huang, "" The software is the latest innovation from prof. He relied on work from psychologists like Dr. Paul Eckman to classiy the six basic emotions."" This totally means that Dr. Huang was able to co-operate with some psychologists to precisely identify the different basic emotions. Sometimes students often show some various degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" In this case, we can conclude that the new technology can precisely identify a student emotion. For this reason, the use of a Facial Action Coding System should be allowed in a classroom.

Secondly, this new technology can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class. Teachers can't always tell if a student is getting confused or bored in class. For instance, not all students in class like to speak up when they are getting confused or bored. With the use of Facial Action Coding System, a teacher can clearly see if a student is getting confused or bored. According to the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" After recognizing, ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" In this case, we can see that the Facial Coding System can recognize when a student is getting bored in class. For this reason, the use of Facial System is valuable because teachers can not always recognize when a student is getting bored in class.

Lastly, the Facial Coding System can create emotional communication. It is not always possible for your friends, teachers or a family member to know how you are feeling. Your friends might sometimes be able to tell due to how you look, but they can't deeply tell what's the problem with you. According to the article ""Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Computers need to understand that too."" It also says in the article that the system can even indicate ""The diference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" These systems can also comuunicate by describing the type of smile you have on your face. For instance, in a false smile, ""The mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and different muscle."" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""Moving your facila muscles not only expresses, emotions, but also may even help produce them."" In this case, we can conclude that these systems are valuable and beneficial in classrooms. For this reason, the use of a Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom.

In conclusion, the use of a Facial Action Coding System is beneficial in a classroom. The system can recognize emotions, it can tell if a student is getting confused or bored in class, and lastly. the system can create emotional communication. With this invention, a teacher does not always need to ask a student about how they are feeling; he/she can precisely tell by looking into the the Facial System.",0,634
37,"The technonogy we have today allows us to create new ideas that can chage our world. Driverless cars is an idea that is a part of the modern age of technology. In the article , the aurthor elaborates on many ways drvierless cars have become a reality in our world today. The technology that allows us to create new ways to keep the raods safe helps our world become a better place.

Every year thousands of people die or get injured becasue of car crashes. Driverless cars can help put an end to the tragic deaths caused by these crashes. In the second paragraph, the author pionts out that Google's independently driven cars have driven more than half a million miles without crashing. Cameras and sensors in cars watch the road and the driver ensuring that the people in the car and the poeple in the car's surroundng are safe. If everyone has the opportunity to drive one of these cars, then crashes will be reduces significantly.

Not only does the new technology in the cars have the abilty to stop crashes, they allow the car tranmit information to the people inside the car incase there is a malfunction. In 2013, BMW announced the start of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Although the progrma does not make cars completely driverless, it shows that we are coming closer to creating cars with the ability to make driving safer. BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" has special touch sensors that makes sure the driver has his or her hand on the steering wheel at all times. Teh new technolgy can sterr, brake and accelerate themselves, but its primary design is to notify the driver when the raid ahead needs the skills of a human driver. Some of these warning include flashing lights or windshield display that can notify the driver if the situation needs human skills.

Although, a completley driverless car is still in the furture, new technolgies have shown that a driverless car is safe enough to invest in. With its features keeping people focused, crashes caused by texting, sleeping, or even drunk driving will decrease. Also the amount of people speeding will drop resulting in less tickets and overall safer rods that everyoen can drive on without the fear of getting in a car crash.",0,381
38,"The Driverless Car of the Future

Driverless cars are the cars of the future. The driverless car itself isn't actually driverless. In fact it is on autopilot for 90% of the time except for when the car needs to go somewhere that only a human can navigate through. The driverless car is more safe than a car that needs a human to drive it, they are more gas sufficient, and they abide by the law.

Driverless cars are not fully driverless, but that will change in the near future as technology advances. The car can accelerate, turn, and brake while observing its surroundings so it does not get into a crash. There is a car coming out in 2016 that can be on autopilot that can travel up to 25 mph without assisstance.

The driverless car is more safe. Google has made a driverless car that has traveled 500,000 miles and the only crash that it had gotten into was because of a human crashed into the car. The cars are very safe and could be inserted into taxis in the near future.

The cars that google forsees is a driverless car that uses half of the gas that the taxis of today use. As gas becomes more rare, it will be more useful if the cars that use gas are more gas sufficient so the gas prices can still stay lower.

In conclusion, the cars are more gas sufficient, and they are more safe than the modern cars of today. The driverless cars will take over the car business in the near future and they will be in the modern house and the taxi systems.",0,276

41,"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certain places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are actually happy that they put this new type of law. Many people preferred to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help reduce this problem. On mondays motorists with evennumbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emissions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.",0,688

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.",0,294
43,"There is a new age coming,and with that means change. Most people dont like change but ths change is a good one. Its useing your car less and use other means of transportsion around your city or town. This leads to less smog around a major city and a safer inviorment for children.

To begin , changing  how we travel around the citys and towns of are country's is esental in this time of age. The world is changing how we think and do thing is changing. We are loseing some of are ignorence. The world we live on is running out of oil and that means no more gas powerd cars. To conserve the resorces we have we need to start takeing the bus to work or school. Or Rideing a skateboard to the shop down the street instead of wasting presious resourses that is going to dissaper in 20 to 30 years. And not useing your car is a go thing ,that means less stress on you mind a body. imagin not having to worry about a car payment and having that extra money tohave fun with you'r kids. Useing your car less also means less smog and cleanier air around. For exsample, in Pairs there was alot of smog so they put a ban on cars for two days and it cleared up the city. Now if started doing this more we would help are invierment so much.

Secound off, Not useing your car as much also creates a much safer enviorment for kids. And they can live a more helthy life. And thats what we want, we want to protect are kids a give them a child hood they can look back on. This means you can let your kid outside and not worring about a drunk driver comeing down the street and hitting your kid and killing them. We want the best futer for are grandchilderns children, and know we set them up for good. We need to start designing are towns and city's like Vauban ,Germany. It will make a better and cleaner world for us.

In conclution, we need to put down the car keys and pick up the bike , or hop on the bus. Because Time is running out. And we dont want it to be to late to change. This is the only thig we got . So lets do it right the firts time and not screw it up.",0,410
44,"My name is Luke Bomberger, and I'm here to tell you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you love farm animals, pretty sights, fun breaks, and rides on the sparkling ocean on nice sunny days, this is definitly the job for you. Of course there are some down sides like storms, but if you take this job seriously, the view of sunup and sundown will make your day very happy!

Reason number one is the fact that you get to to take care of all the animals! The types of animals you take care of are: horses, young cows, mules, and more! You'll feed them, give them water, and clean there pens. If that doesn't sound nice to you, reason number two will definitly wake you at least kinda want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program

Reason number two was one of my favorites, the beautiful sights! On every trip, we see at the least one beautiful sight. We toured an exavated castle and it was very beautiful.

Reason number three is when we arrive on land, people unload the animals while we get to play a bunch of games! We play vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing and more! If you aren't into thats stuff, you can always do something yourself like reading or whittling.

My last and final reason is the view of the beautiful ocean. On sunny days when the ocean is calm, you can go on the deck and just look at the way the sun shines on the ocean. Even at night the moon sometimes gives enought light to shine in the ocean, and it makes a very pretty reflection. If I had to describe the beauty two words they would be, very beautiful.

If being with animals, pretty sights, free time, and the sparking ocean didn't convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, I don't know what else will. To those of you that do join, good luck to you and I hope you have fun.",0,335
45,"I believe we the people should be able to vote for who we want for president.  We have always been told we have a freesdom of speech, yet we cannot truely vote for who we want for president.  The votes are alol taken and used to see who is more popular with the people.  But who decided who gets tp be presdident is not us.  It is the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is a group of people in each state who decide the president for us.  I think everyone should get to vote on who they want as president, and i think it should actually count.  The Electoral College is unfair and I believe popular vote should decide who we get as the president of the nation that we have or rights to vote in.

In the words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the Electoal college.""  It is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  It is unfair because pf the winner-takes-all system there is in each state.  With this in place the canidates take no time in the states they know they have not of chance of winning in.  Instead they spend all of their time in states they may have a tight race in.  for example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the canidates at all. Twenty-five of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad.  Under the Electoral College system they do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who then turn around and vote for the president they want.  Is that really fair.  That we are putting our nations future in the hands of only 538 people.

Popular votes should be what decides our president.  Therefore we actually have a say in who we want to be president.  For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidental race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide,  but because of the Electoral College Bush won because he had 271 electoral votes while Gore had 266.  Also in the election in2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes comparing to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.  Sure he still would have won but at least individual people actually had a say in who they got as their president.  Also in 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida, but Obama won the electoral vote with 29 .  But in Wyoming the same thing happened and he only got three electoral votes.  This shows a large state gets more attention in presidential canidates than a small state does.  If presidency was decided by the individual votes then it wouold be more fair and more poeple would have a say in it.

If this country really gave us the right to vote then we would really have a say in who we want as our president.  But the Electoral College is not letting us do that.  Only two states do something a little differently, but it still does not make that much of a difference.  If we had more of a say in our presidency i believe we would be a better nation more people would actually vote cause there would be a better chance of them actually having a say in what they want for this nation.",0,553
46,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" makes me claim that this technology should be used to read students emitonal expressions to help them with their learning. In the begiining of the article it talks about how the new software can detect emotions of others. At first it sounded weird to have your face scanned to see what your emition is. But it later makes sense later on why you should have face scanned to see your emtotion.

Later in the article it talks about how the facial reconition can help you through out your life. For example paragraph 6 sentence 4 for says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could moditfy the lesson ,like an effective human instructor."" So when I read that it makes more sense to do that becuse not all teachers will not know if a student will understand a question or lesson. Or some students are scared to say they dont understand a question or lesson because they might be scared to speak up. But with a facial scanner no student will not need to be scared to ask if they don't understand a question. Plus not all student's learn the same way, so if a student doesn't understand something becuase the way its being taught the Facial Action Code System can scan their face and find another way to help slove the problem.

In conclusion I find Facial Action Coding System as a postive impact for students. Its the latest tech so its not an old system. The scanner can tell if a student doesn't understand a problem. And find another problem to help them. Also knows your emoitions on how you feel about certian things or if you need help on something.",0,300
47,"I'm going to talk now about a such interesting articte called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

This article talks about how a new type of technology for the computers called Facial Action Coding System is able to ""calculate"" your facial expressions and know how do you feel in that exact moment; sad, happy, surprised, angry... The author show an example about the Mona Lisa of her facial expressions, and that was de result of it:

""She's 63 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry"". The process for this new system begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles. Every time those muscles moves create a new expression in your face, and depend of the movements of your muscles you will have one emotion or another that the computer will detect.

I think that is an a good idea but it doesn't convince me at all. Dr. Huang say "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", my opinion for this is that when you are at the school and you are reading something that it looks interesting for you and makes you happy, you will not be smiling at the screen of the computer, you will just be enjoying yourself about what are you reading. So if my muscles are not expressing any emotion the computer will probably detect that I'm bored and it will change what I'm reading. And for this reason I think that woul be a problem in more than just one situation.

I did like this articte but I didn""t simle when I was reading it, so my conclusion is that I don't think that a computer will be able to ""calculate"" your emotions looking the muscles of your face.",0,315

I would have to disagree with that, and just believe it is a natural landform. There has many research done and work to figure out what the Face on Mars is, and saying it was created by aliens puts that hard work to shame.

The Face on Mars is a qustionable conspiracy. However, I believe The Face on Mars is a natural landform because we have no evidence of alien lifeform. In the article it states, ""MichaelMalin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thosands of anxious web surfers waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform"". Based on this evidence I can state their was no sight of any aliens. I believe there are other natural reasons as to why their is an object that looks like a face on Mars. Pictures were taken as well to show proof that their isn't any alien lifeform on Mars. It also states in the article that the Face on Mars is more equivalent to a butte or a mesa which are natural landforms. Although people may have wondered if there was lifeform on Mars, technology wasn't as advanced back then. As years went on, technology became greater, and we were able to use that technolgy to see if there was signs of life.

In conclusion, I believe aliens did not create the Face on Mars. I believe this because there is not any proof or reseach to show that aliens do exist. The face on Mars is just a natural landform, and there has work done for many years to show it.",0,308
49,"Limiting car usages is becoming more popular everyday. Different places in the world are starting new days and such to limit the use of automobiles. Things such as just a day of limiting people from using their car is making a difference in the world. Limiting car usage can be an advantage becuase it is helping create new enviroments and is also changing old enviroments for the better.

The communities are being designed to help people live a different and new way. The only forms of transportation are walking and biking places. These towns however have everything built to fit this life style. In a german suburb the residents are required to not have a car in order to live in that community. If they must have a car, there is only two places to park it, a large garage at the edge of this development. In these garages a car-owner would buy a space for $40,000 along with a home. With this as a factor, 70 percent of families in this Vauban communties do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to this new, happier suburb. In source 1, It is said that the plans of making cities better for walking is finally happening.

In source 3 a businessman said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". The use of cars stresses people out for various reasons. A day without cars is spreading, for example in colombia for the first time two other cities beside bogata joined in on the day where civilians would be fined for using a car. Smog is a big factor now-a-days aswell. Cutting back on car usage is helping many cities with smog and reducing it. In paris they restricted certian cars from driving on the road on certian days and this actaully helped the enviroment a lot aswell as helping traffic.

While cars are a big help in today's world they are not absolutley nessecary. Cars can help you be transported from one place to another but they also hurt the enviroment in various ways. Limiting car usuage is an adavantage to the world becuase not only does it help create new healthier enviroments it also is fixing the old ones and making them better for the future.",0,384

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical method for electing the President of the United States. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. The process of selecting electors, the meeting of these electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress ensure a fair and constitutionally sound election process. The Electoral College has been successfully used for centuries and changing it would require significant modifications to the Constitution.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote and ensures a clear outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the popular vote is more probable than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. Therefore, maintaining the Electoral College ensures a more stable and predictable election process.

In addition, the Electoral College promotes representation of all regions in the United States. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning specific regions and encourages them to campaign across the entire country. It ensures that the interests and concerns of all regions are taken into account in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states. This system incentivizes candidates to dedicate more attention and resources to states where the election outcome is uncertain. As a result, voters in these swing states are more likely to be engaged and informed about the candidates' positions and policies. Their thoughtful votes should have a significant influence in deciding the election, and the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the power among small and large states. The system helps to restore some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, the Electoral College allows large states to receive more attention from presidential candidates compared to small states. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and interests of diverse states, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and effective.

While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, such as greater fairness to voters and increased attention to all states, the existing system of the Electoral College has proven to be functional, practical, and has multiple advantages that outweigh these potential benefits.

In conclusion, it is important to maintain the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a valuable and effective system. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to the electoral process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

51,"The shifting culture around car usage, as discussed by various sources, presents a picture of a future where limiting car usage is not only advantageous but perhaps even inevitable. This essay explores some of the key benefits of reducing dependency on personal vehicles, as highlighted by a multi-city experience in Europe, Colombia, and the United States.

Firstly, Rosenthal's discussion of the German suburb of Vauban paints a vivid picture of a car-light society (Passage 1). In Vauban, 70% of residents have chosen to live without a car, thanks to a city model that welcomes pedestrians and restricts vehicle ownership and usage within the city. This creates a less stressful and quieter environment, as residents are not constantly burdened by the tension that comes with owning and maintaining a car. Furthermore, Vauban’s streets are almost entirely car-free, fostering a safe and serene atmosphere (Passage 1).

Aside from the evident lifestyle benefits, limiting car usage contributes to an important global cause- reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As Rosenthal underlines, passenger cars account for 12 to 50 percent of these emissions varying by geographical location (Passage 5). Therefore, a decrease in personal vehicles usage, as seen in Vauban, can significantly contribute to the combat against climate change. 

Even on a temporary basis, a limitation on car usage has shown positive results. In Paris for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to near-record pollution levels. As a result, smog congestion decreased by 60% (Passage 14). This demonstrates how targeted initiatives to limit car usage can significantly improve air quality in a relatively short span of time, thereby creating healthier living conditions in urban areas. 

A similar approach was undertaken in Bogota, in the form of a car-free day (Passage 20). This policy encouraged alternative transportation methods, reducing air pollution while simultaneously promoting healthier options such as biking or walking. 

Rosenthal also speculates that a wider societal shift is currently underway in the United States, with people buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses (Passage 29-31). This cultural shift, driven by various factors - the Internet and telecommuting, urban living appeal, and flexible commuting arrangements, among others - is projected by some to continue into the future (Passage 35). 

In conclusion, limiting car usage confers numerous advantages. It can contribute to the improvement of our mental well-being, urban air quality, and climate health. Furthermore, the emergence of car-light communities and a possible cultural shift in attitudes toward owning cars signal a sustainable and responsible future. Nonetheless, necessary infrastructural changes and public policies should be instituted to further encourage this shift and guide our world towards a more sustainable future.",1,437
52,"The Development of Driverless Cars 

While driverless cars present many potential benefits, there are also real risks that need to be addressed before fully implementing this new technology. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents caused by human error and increase mobility for those unable to drive. However, the technology is still in development and many questions remain regarding safety and privacy. 

One positive aspect discussed is that over 90% of car accidents are caused by human error factors like distraction, drunkenness or fatigue. By removing the human element, driverless cars could potentially reduce accidents. The software is also capable of continuously monitoring conditions and making split-second decisions to avoid collisions. This suggests autonomous vehicles may one day be safer than human drivers on the road. At the same time, technology is not perfect and software or sensors could also malfunction in ways that lead to accidents. Before self-driving cars are widespread, developers must find ways to minimize these risks through testing and backup systems. 

In addition, the article notes driverless cars could help the elderly and disabled gain independent transportation. This increased mobility would expand opportunities and quality of life for many. Nevertheless, some argue the technology still needs years of refinement to handle all traffic situations autonomously without human intervention. More testing is warranted to verify these vehicles can drive as safely as people in all conditions like snow, heavy rain or construction zones. Their ability to properly identify pedestrians and react accordingly in unexpected scenarios must be proven.

In conclusion, while driverless cars show promise, more research is still required before fully implementing this technology. Developers must find ways to minimize risks from software or sensor issues. Additional testing in diverse environments is also important to verify autonomous vehicles can drive as safely as humans in all situations. With further development and safety precautions, driverless cars may eventually create benefits through increased safety and accessibility. However, their widespread adoption will depend on convincingly addressing outstanding questions around security and dependability. Taking a cautious approach by continuing to improve and test the technology seems warranted at this stage.",1,356
53,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards limiting car usage in communities around the world. This shift is driven by various factors, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The passage set highlights that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to smog and respiratory problems. The passage set gives examples of cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Limiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. Not owning a car can be liberating and lead to a less stressful lifestyle. In the passage set, residents of Vauban, Germany, express their happiness at not owning cars, stating that they feel more relaxed and at ease. This is because car ownership comes with various costs and responsibilities, such as maintenance, insurance, and finding parking spaces. By limiting car usage, individuals can save money and reduce the stress and hassles associated with car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and walkable communities. The passage set mentions the trend of making suburbs more accessible to public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities in this way, we can reduce the need for cars and promote healthier and more active lifestyles. Walking or cycling as a means of transportation also has various health benefits, such as increased physical activity and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this movement and prioritize smart planning that limits car usage in order to build a more sustainable future.",1,448
54,"Studying Venus is indeed a Worthy Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy goal, even considering the extreme dangers involved. While Venus has a hostile environment capable of ending human life within minutes, the potential scientific rewards outweigh these risks. The evidence presented suggests our understanding of Earth and other terrestrial planets could advance greatly through Venus exploration. 

Several key details support this. Venus is very similar in size, composition, and early evolutionary history to Earth, yet ended up with a runaway greenhouse effect turning its surface into an inferno. By learning how and why Venus diverged so dramatically from our planet, scientists may gain crucial insights into climate dynamics and ways to prevent similar catastrophes here. The article also notes Venus' dense atmosphere could reveal processes involved in atmospheric evolution. Given the threats of global warming, such insights could prove invaluable for protecting Earth's biosphere long-term. 

Moreover, Venus may still have active geology which could shed light on terrestrial plate tectonics and volcanic activity. Its lack of liquid water and magnetic field likely influenced these processes differently than on Earth. Comparing the two worlds may thus enhance understanding of geophysical forces shaping terrestrial planets. While exploring Venus poses clear dangers, the scientific payoffs, as outlined by the author, demonstrate it represents a worthy target for study that could educate efforts to safeguard habitability on our own world far into the future. For these reasons, the author presents a persuasive case that Venus exploration merits undertaking despite the extreme hazards.",1,256
55,"Introduction:

The exploration of Venus has always been a topic of great interest and challenge for scientists and space agencies. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea by examining the evidence presented in the article.

Claim:

The author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting the significant scientific benefits, discussing the challenges and obstacles, and providing examples of past successes.

Evidence:

One of the significant scientific benefits of studying Venus, as mentioned in the article, is the potential to gain a better understanding of Earth's climate. The author states, ""Venus and Earth are similar in size and mass, and they are both rocky planets with atmospheres, making Venus a valuable proxy for understanding Earth's climate"" (para. 4). This information highlights the importance of studying Venus in order to gain insights into Earth's climate, which is a crucial area of research in today's world.

Another point the author makes is that studying Venus can help us better understand the potential for life on other planets. The author states, ""Venus is a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life, as its thick atmosphere and extreme greenhouse effect make it a promising place to search for signs of life"" (para. 6). This information suggests that studying Venus could lead to breakthroughs in the search for extraterrestrial life, which is a topic that has fascinated scientists and the general public alike for decades.

The author also discusses the challenges and obstacles of studying Venus, such as the extreme heat and pressure on the planet's surface. However, they also provide examples of past successes, such as the Soviet Union's Venera missions, which sent probes to Venus in the 1960s and 1970s. The author states, ""Despite the challenges, the Venera missions were able to send back valuable data about Venus's atmosphere, surface, and geology"" (para. 8). This information shows that it is possible to overcome the challenges of studying Venus and that past missions have been successful in gathering valuable data.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting the significant scientific benefits, discussing the challenges and obstacles, and providing examples of past successes. The evidence presented in the article demonstrates the importance of studying Venus in order to gain a better understanding of Earth's climate and the potential for life on other planets. While the challenges of studying Venus are significant, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile pursuit. Therefore, I agree with the author's claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1,465
56,"Exploring Venus is Undeniably Worth the Risk 

The pursuit of scientific discovery holds great rewards, but often presents real dangers as well. In his article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that studying Venus remains a worthy goal despite the immense challenges it poses. Through specific evidence from the harsh conditions on Venus, the author makes a compelling case for why learning more about our neighboring planet is worth risking great hardship.

The author first details just how unforgiving the Venusian environment truly is. Its surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit would melt lead, and its atmosphere exerts over 90 times the pressure found at Earth's surface due to its dense carbon dioxide composition. Merely surviving even brief exposure to these conditions seems impossible. However, the author explains that much can still be learned from robotic probes designed to withstand such extremes. For example, we have gained valuable insights into atmospheric dynamics and the potential for life elsewhere by hardening our technology to probe Venus's poisonous climate. 

Next, the article discusses the intriguing geological discoveries that further Venus exploration could reveal. Landers may uncover clues to how the planet transformed from a possibly habitable world into the inferno it is today. Comparing Venus to Earth could yield important lessons in climate change and greenhouse gases. The recent discovery of volcanic activity on Venus suggests its geology remains active today, with unknown implications. Clearly, more study of our sister planet holds answers to profound questions about planetary evolution.

In sum, the author provides strong support for the proposition that researching Venus merits enduring its hazards. Even though direct human exploration is implausible now, steadily innovating our probe technology to gradually expand our knowledge of Venus piece by piece is worthwhile. The potential scientific payoffs in fields from astronomy to climate science demonstrate why tackling Venus's challenges remains a worthy endeavor, as does satisfying our innate drive to explore the unknown. For these reasons, the author makes a persuasive case that Venus studies are an invaluable pursuit regardless of the immense risks.",1,343
57,"While personal transport provides convenience, limiting car usage has significant environmental and community benefits. Alternative modes of transportation can alleviate traffic and pollution issues while promoting healthier lifestyles.

Walking, biking, and public transit are more sustainable options that reduce emissions and road congestion. According to Sources 1 and 2, motor vehicles are a leading cause of air pollution in cities. They release nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and other substances that contribute to poor health outcomes like respiratory illnesses. Source 3 also notes that cars are a primary factor in rising carbon emissions globally. By driving less, we lessen our collective environmental impact and move towards more eco-friendly urban planning. 

Non-motorized mobility has added perks beyond lowering emissions. Sources 1 and 2 discuss how cycling and walking are physically active modes that aid public health. Regular exercise can help prevent issues like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. When streets have less traffic, they also become safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Some cities addressed in Source 2 saw declines in road accidents after boosting alternative transit networks.

Public transportation fills an important niche as a high-capacity, lower-emissions option. As described in Source 4, well-developed subway, bus and train systems enable large numbers of commuters to travel long distances without cars. This reduces the number of vehicles on the road at peak hours. Public transit likewise eases traffic congestion and saves on infrastructure costs compared to accommodating only private vehicles. When combined with initiatives to make neighborhoods more pedestrian-friendly, limiting personal car use through expanded public options leads to efficiency gains for communities.

In conclusion, curbing excessive automobile dependence yields environmental benefits like decreased emissions and pollution, as well as public health advantages from increased physical activity. Alternative transportation modes provide viable substitutes that alleviate traffic and make cities more livable and sustainable places. Mixed-use development and multi-modal planning can support reduced car usage while still meeting transportation needs.",1,316

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is essential to carefully consider the arguments from both sides before making a decision that will impact the future of our democratic process. In this letter, I will present the case for both perspectives using evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to those over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system used by most states ensures that a slight plurality in a state results in a substantial electoral-vote victory. While a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. Thus, the Electoral College ensures a decisive outcome in presidential elections.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to make every citizen feel represented. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. As a result, candidates are motivated to campaign in various regions, ensuring that the interests of all citizens are taken into account. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning states with heavy party affiliations and neglecting the concerns of other regions. Consequently, the Electoral College promotes a sense of inclusivity and prevents regional divides.

The swing states also play a crucial role in the Electoral College system. These states receive heightened attention from presidential candidates due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes. As Bradford Plumer states, voters in these toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, respond to candidate messages effectively, and be more thoughtful in their decision-making process. Their swing votes essentially determine the outcome of the election. This focus encourages candidates to address the needs and concerns of swing states, ensuring that their interests are considered.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to give weight to large states in the political balance. Judge Posner highlights that the Electoral College offsets the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that large states have more influence in the presidential election. This is notable because presidential candidates prioritize campaigning in states with large populations, which would result in more attention being directed towards these states. The Electoral College thus maintains a level of equity among states, preventing smaller states from being overshadowed.

While the Electoral College holds various advantages, it is important to acknowledge the arguments in favor of an election by popular vote. Detractors often argue that the system is unfair to voters, as candidates tend to focus solely on the swing states. According to Bradford Plumer, this leads to presidential campaigns neglecting certain states, with Rhode Island and South Carolina being examples from the 2000 campaign. However, the Electoral College provides a slender advantage to less populous states and ensures that their voices are not drowned out by the larger states. Additionally, voters in non-swing states still possess the power to engage in the democratic process by expressing their political preferences.

In conclusion, there are valid arguments to both keep the Electoral College and change to an election by popular vote. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures every citizen feels represented, and gives weight to both swing states and large states. Nonetheless, it is essential to seek a balance that addresses the concerns of detractors, such as ensuring that candidates value the concerns of all states. As we consider the future of our democratic process, it is crucial to approach this issue with careful consideration and keep the best interests of our nation in mind.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedication to serving the people of our great state. I trust that you will consider all perspectives before making a decision on this important issue.

59,"Studying Venus Despite the Dangers

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy scientific pursuit, even given the planet's extremely hazardous environmental conditions. While Venus presents clear dangers to possible exploration efforts, the potential scientific discoveries strongly outweigh these risks. 

Key evidence supports this assessment. Venus has similarities to Earth as a terrestrial planet, yet its atmosphere and climate could not be more different. This stark contrast begs for explanation as scientists seek to understand climate change and the potential divergence of planetary atmospheres. Exploring Venus up close could help solve long-standing mysteries about its evolution. Moreover, the planet's hyperdense atmosphere may yield insights applicable to weather forecasting and other atmospheric sciences on Earth. 

These unique opportunities for advancing scientific knowledge constitute a powerful argument for accepting the inherent dangers of Venus exploration. Though conditions at the surface would destroy terrestrial life and equipment almost instantly, emerging technologies like atmospheric balloons and floaters offer promising workarounds. By limiting direct contact and leveraging material-engineering innovations, missions could harvest valuable data while minimizing risk to human explorers, if any are involved. 

In conclusion, the author builds a credible case that studying Venus merits undertaking despite the hazards. Venus presents scientific riddles holding clues about Earth's past and future climate behavior as well as atmospheric dynamics in general. Though risky, well-designed missions leveraging emerging technologies could reap major rewards by helping solve these puzzles. For the potential insights into our own planet and others, braving the harsh Venusian environment seems a challenge worth accepting.",1,255

For years I lived and worked on my family's ranch in southern Texas, tending to our cattle day in and day out. While I loved being outdoors and the sense of purpose my work provided, I often found myself dreaming of what adventures might lie beyond the horizon. Then I came across an article about a unique program called Seagoing Cowboys, which gave ranch hands the chance to spend time aboard tall ships, experiencing life at sea while helping crew vessels around the world. I knew immediately this was just the opportunity I had been waiting for. 

This program offered experiences I never could have imagined on the ranch. As the article detailed, I would get to set sail on historic sail training ships to international ports, gaining exposure to diverse cultures along the way. No longer would my surroundings be defined by barbed wire fences and grazing cattle. Instead, the open ocean would be my office, with constantly changing seascapes as far as the eye could see. I also looked forward to learning new skills, like navigating by the stars and operating the sails without motors. These would be valuable lessons that would stay with me for life, far beyond the duration of the program.

Perhaps most importantly, participating in Seagoing Cowboys opened my eyes to just how small my world had been up to that point. As the article noted, I was able to witness endangered species like humpback whales in their natural habitat. I met people from all over the world and heard their stories, gaining a new appreciation for other cultures and ways of life. The program truly broadened my horizons in a way a desk job never could have. Now, whenever I feel like my work is becoming routine, I think back to my voyages with Seagoing Cowboys and am instantly re-energized and eager to take on new challenges. 

It is clear to me this program is an unparalleled opportunity for personal and professional growth.

61,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to share my perspective on the ongoing debate around the Electoral College system versus selecting the President by a nationwide popular vote. After reviewing information from multiple sources on the arguments for both sides, I believe the Electoral College should be kept as is.

One of the key reasons is that the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a variety of states and regions. If we went to a popular vote system, candidates would likely focus all of their attention on densely populated areas. This could undermine the voices of smaller states and rural communities. As one source explained, the current system encourages geographically diverse campaigning rather than candidates just focusing on big cities. 

Some argue a popular vote would be more democratic since it would align with the nationwide vote totals. However, others point out this ignores the federal character of the U.S. system, with power divided between the national government and state governments. The Electoral College system helps to maintain this balance of federalism by allocating electoral votes partly based on the number of representatives but also providing two votes for each state no matter the population size. This recognizes the importance of both population and the role of states.

It is also worth considering that switching to a popular vote system could potentially reduce voter turnout. Currently, the all-or-nothing allocation of electoral votes in each state helps generate more enthusiasm and motivation for voters since their ballots can really impact the outcome in their state. A national popular vote may not carry the same impact or sense of consequence for voters in most states. Overall, I believe keeping the current Electoral College system best serves the balanced, federalist framework of our democratic system. However, I am open to alternative proposals that could address criticism of the current approach while still maintaining its advantages. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.",1,327

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

The system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.

Sincerely,

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which the President of the United States is elected. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote.

One of the key reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the outcome of the election is clear and reduces the likelihood of disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to closer margins and potential disputes over results, as evident in the 2000 election.

Another important consideration is that the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. Judge Posner highlights that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the election and potentially neglecting the interests of other regions. In this way, the Electoral College promotes a more unified and balanced representation.

Additionally, the focus on swing states in the electoral system encourages candidates to campaign and connect with voters across the country. As mentioned by Judge Posner, candidates direct their efforts towards toss-up states, where voters are more attentive and engaged in the political process. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who closely consider the candidates' messages, have a significant impact on the election outcome. It encourages candidates to address issues that are relevant to a wide range of voters, rather than solely appealing to the interests of densely populated areas.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a system that proportionately recognizes the influence of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large states, as they receive more attention from candidates due to their larger number of electoral votes. This prevents a situation where candidates solely focus on the needs of highly-populated areas, thus allowing for a more diverse representation of interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time and resources by providing a clear winner and preventing the possibility of extended election cycles. The integrity of the election process is maintained, and the transition of power is smoother and more efficient.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained due to its ability to provide a clear outcome, promote trans-regional representation, encourage candidate engagement across all states, proportionately recognize the importance of large and small states, and prevent run-off elections. While the popular vote may seem appealing, it is important to consider the practical benefits and safeguards that the Electoral College offers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to carefully consider the advantages outlined above when evaluating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

Sincerely,

64,"The Face on Mars has long captured the imagination of many who speculated it was an artificial structure created by an ancient alien civilization. However, upon closer inspection, the evidence suggests the Face is simply a product of natural geological formations and processes occurring on Mars over billions of years. 

Some of the key claims supporting the idea that the Face is natural include its vague resemblance once seen up close. Early low-resolution photos from orbit made it look like an anthropic construct, but higher resolution images revealed it to be an indistinct hillside that only superficially resembles a human face from certain angles. The article also notes there are similar mesas and hillsides on Mars that look vaguely face-like without any real features. This implies face-like landforms can be produced naturally through erosion over eons without any intelligence involved. 

Additional evidence cited in the article is how wind erosion shapes the land on Mars. Strong winds pick up and move particles of dust and ice across the surface, slowly wearing away at rock and soil. Over massive stretches of geological time, this could reasonably create shallow clefts and cavities that give the impression of eyes, nose and mouth when viewed remotely. The article notes how scientists have modeled this process and their simulations match what is seen on the actual Face. This lends credibility to the idea that natural wind erosion alone could generate the loose likeness to a human face.

In conclusion, while early low-quality images sparked speculation of an artificial construct, upon closer examination the evidence suggests the Face on Mars is most plausibly a random, vague arrangement of natural landforms shaped simply by environmental processes over Martian history. The resemblance is superficial and fleeting, an example of pareidolia rather than proof of an alien artifact or structure. For these reasons, the weight of scientific evidence supports classifying the Face on Mars as a naturally-occurring geological formation rather than something created by an ancient alien civilization.",1,329
65,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from International Experiments

Reducing car usage has considerable implications for our society, environment, and personal well-being. It promotes more sustainable urban development, decreases pollution, and contributes to healthier lifestyles. Insights from global examples like Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Columbia; and shifts in the American car culture illuminate the myriad benefits of limiting car usage.

Vauban, Germany sets the stage with its pioneering suburb that has heavily limited car usage. With 70% of families not owning cars, Vauban's initiative reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly contributed by cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Such car-free environments are also considered conducive to less stressful, more community-oriented lifestyles, as noted by Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

In Paris, the reduction in car usage led to a significant decrease in smog and pollution. The partial driving ban led to a 60% reduction in congestion and an improvement in the city's air quality, affirming the positive environmental impact of limiting car usage (Duffer). Similarly, the ""Day Without Cars"" event in Bogota, Columbia, aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Its success lays testament to the effectiveness of this approach in large urban communities (Selsky).

In the United States, a shift is occurring where Americans are buying fewer cars and increasingly opting for alternatives like public transportation or biking. This not only reduces carbon emissions but also aligns with changing social and demographic trends. As Michael Sivak, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, notes, this could indicate a fundamental shift in transportation and mobility trends (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

However, reducing car usage is not merely about improving the environment. It reshapes urban spaces to be more accessible, compact, and community-centered, especially in suburbs where car usage is traditionally high (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Additionally, it opens opportunities for innovative mobility solutions, as illustrated by Bill Ford’s business plan, focusing on a connected network of diverse transportation modes (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

In contrast to the previous car-dominated culture, there is a growing trend towards creating sustainable, transit-oriented communities where car usage is limited. This shift represents a move towards a healthier, more sustainable, and community-oriented future. It is essential for fellow citizens to understand the advantages of limiting car usage, and take steps towards embracing this new model of mobility and urban living. By doing so, we can contribute positively to reducing our environmental impact, improving societal well-being, and paving the way for a more sustainable future.",1,416

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved due to its various benefits and practical reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In each state, the winning candidate receives all the electoral votes, providing a clear result. This minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome, as reflected in the 2000 Presidential Election, where the dispute arose from the popular vote rather than the Electoral College. The Electoral College system has historically maintained a strong correspondence between the popular vote and the electoral vote, with discrepancies being an exception rather than the rule.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""Everyone's President."" With its requirement of trans-regional appeal, a candidate must cater to the interests and concerns of citizens from various regions. The candidates must focus on obtaining support from diverse states in order to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the President represents and governs for the entirety of the nation, rather than catering solely to regional interests. By avoiding a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal can win the election, the Electoral College guarantees the legitimacy and effectiveness of the elected President.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes enhances the significance of swing states. These states, where the outcome is uncertain and can swing either way, capture the attention of the candidates. Voters in these states pay more attention to the campaign, analyze the policies and positions of the candidates more closely, and become more engaged in the political process. As a result, the Electoral College system encourages thoughtful voting and ensures that the most informed and engaged citizens make the deciding choices in the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the impact of big states and small states. While the Senate already addresses the issue of representation for small states, the Electoral College allows for increased attention and significance to be given to states with larger populations. This ensures that presidential candidates must address the concerns and priorities of citizens in populous states like California and Florida, where their policies have a greater potential impact. It prevents a scenario where candidates can ignore these states and focus solely on winning small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections. The system guarantees that a clear winner emerges, even if a candidate does not secure a majority of the popular vote. By providing a decisive result, it prevents prolonged and complicated runoff election processes, enabling a smooth transition of executive power.

While some argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than solely focusing on determining the outcome. It is also worth mentioning that about half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their individual vote may not swing the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served as a practical and functional method in electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes a President who represents all citizens, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the interests of big and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. While no system is perfect, the merits of the Electoral College outweigh the potential disadvantages. I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College and advocate for its preservation.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the merits of both sides of the debate before making a decision. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or have any questions.

69,"Hey guys, today im gonna tell you why we should limit car usage. First of all, cars are really bad for the environment. They make a lot of pollution, which can make it hard to breath and can even make us sick. This is bad news, especialy for people who have things like asthma. Also, cars make a lot of Co2, which contributes to clmate change. Climate change is causing really bad things like floods, droughts, and really hot summers. It's like, we need to do something about it before its too late.

Another reason why we should limit car usage is because it's really bad for our heath. Sitting in a car for a long time can make us really unhealthy. It can make us gain weight and can even give us diseases like heart disease and diabetes. This is crazy! We should be walking or biking instead. It's way better for us and its also way better for the planet.

Also, cars are really expensive. Like, who can aford a car? Not me! And parking is such a pain. Sometimes i feel like i'm going to be late for school because i can't find a parking spot. It's so stressful. If we limited car usage, we wouldn't have to worry about this stuff.

So, what can we do? We can start by taking public transportation. Buses and trains are way better for the environment and they're way cheaper. We can also bike or walk. It's good exercise and it's good for the planet. And, we can car pool. If we all car pool, we can reduce the amount of cars on the road. This will help the environment and it will also help us save money on gas.

So, in conclusion, limiting car usage is really important. It's good for the environment, its good for our health, and its good for our wallets. We should all try to limit our car usage and make a difference. Thanks for reading!",1,331
70,"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite Significant Challenges

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case that continuing to study Venus is worthwhile, even given the planet's inhospitable conditions. While Venus presents extreme dangers to exploration, the scientific rewards of investigating our closest planetary neighbor justify facing these risks. 

Several key pieces of evidence from the article support this view. First, Venus remains relatively unexplored compared to other planets in our solar system. Due to the planet's thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, only a handful of spacecraft have successfully visited Venus' surface. However, this limited exploration means Venus still holds many secrets waiting to be uncovered. Gaining a deeper understanding of Venus' makeup and evolution could provide insight into Earth's own history and climate. 

Second, new Venus exploration missions planned by NASA and the European Space Agency aim to directly address the challenges of Venus' harsh environment. For instance, proposed capsules designed to float high in the atmosphere would allow for extended observation while avoiding the heat and pressure at the surface. Technological advancements in heat-resistant materials and miniaturization of instruments have also increased the feasibility of robust planetary science from Venus. If successful, these planned missions could finally crack Venus' mysteries after decades of sparse study.

While exploring Venus certainly entails risks, the potential scientific rewards justify facing them according to the article. Unlocking Venus' secrets through further investigation helps achieve an important goal of planetary science—understanding the evolution of terrestrial planets like our own. With careful planning and innovative solutions to Venus' extremes, studying this world remains a worthy pursuit that should continue. For these reasons, the author makes a convincing case that Venus exploration merits continued support and resources despite its difficulties.",1,295
71,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent in many parts of the world. One example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where car ownership is discouraged. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents actually sold their cars to move there. According to one resident, life without a car has reduced stress and made them happier. This suburban experiment demonstrates the potential benefits of separating suburban life from auto use.

The trend of separating suburbs from car usage is not limited to Germany. It is also being adopted in other parts of Europe, the United States, and the developing world. Planners are aiming to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are being placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. Transportation for America, a coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States, is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. This shift in planning is necessary, as passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.

The advantages of limiting car usage are not only environmental, but also social and economic. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. Congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Delivery companies did suffer some financial losses due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for specific types of vehicles, such as plug-in cars and hybrids. Public transit was also made free of charge during this period. This example shows that limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality and reduce congestion in cities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the quality of life in cities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The program has spread to other countries, and there has been a significant decrease in traffic congestion during the car-free day. The event has also led to the construction of more bicycle paths and parks, improved sidewalks, and the development of new restaurants and shopping districts. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable cities with better infrastructure and amenities.

There are several factors contributing to the decrease in car usage. One major factor is the shift in behavior among Americans. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been steadily decreasing since then. This decrease in driving has environmental benefits, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also leading to changes in the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range. This shift in behavior is attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, the availability of car-pooling apps, and the proliferation of car-sharing programs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease congestion, and create more livable cities. The shift towards limiting car usage is not limited to one country but is a global trend. It is important for policymakers, urban planners, and individuals to recognize the benefits of reducing car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and accessible communities.",1,586
72,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage has gained momentum in recent years, with numerous benefits becoming apparent. One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 70% of families in the community do not own cars. This means that residents are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transit. These activities contribute to increased physical activity and better overall health. In fact, in Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day resulted in millions of people hiking, biking, and skating to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The passage about Paris discusses how a partial driving ban was enforced due to intense smog. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Vehicles, especially diesel ones, are a major source of air pollution, so reducing their usage can have a significant impact on the quality of air we breathe.

In addition to these environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient and sustainable urban planning. The passage mentions the concept of ""smart planning,"" which involves separating suburban life from auto use. This means creating communities where stores are located within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible. By doing so, we can reduce the need for large parking spaces, which take up valuable land, and encourage more people to use alternative modes of transportation.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 57% of families sold a car to move there. This suggests that owning a car is a significant financial burden for many individuals and families. By reducing car usage, people can save money on car ownership, fuel, insurance, and maintenance costs. Additionally, the passage mentions that delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris. However, exceptions were made for vehicles carrying three or more passengers, which encourages carpooling and helps reduce transportation costs for individuals.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthy lifestyles, improvement of air quality, more efficient urban planning, and economic benefits. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can create greener, healthier, and more sustainable communities.",1,467

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to urge you to support its continuation. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, I believe that it serves an essential purpose in our presidential elections and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present several reasons why the Electoral College is beneficial for our democratic system.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. Unlike the popular vote, which can be disputed and subject to recounts, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner. As stated by Judge Richard Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote, creating a decisive victory. This eliminates the potential for prolonged disputes and uncertainty that could arise from a direct popular vote system.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation rather than just a few densely populated areas. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from solely focusing on large, populous states while neglecting smaller ones. This is crucial for maintaining a balanced representation and preventing disenfranchisement. As Judge Posner highlights, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, and it is essential for the residents of all regions to feel that their votes count and that the president will represent their interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, thereby engaging voters and fostering a more informed electorate. Instead of concentrating solely on safe states or densely populated areas, candidates are compelled to address the concerns and priorities of voters in swing states. As a result, voters in these states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaigns and become more thoughtful voters. This increased attention and information lead to a more robust democratic process and a better-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, as it restores some weight to the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Under the Electoral College system, a large state like Florida, with a close popular vote, receives more attention from presidential candidates than a smaller state like Wyoming. This ensures that presidential candidates have an incentive to address the concerns and needs of voters in both big and small states, promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This system provides a clear winner and avoids the potential complications and costs associated with run-off elections. As demonstrated by past elections, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a decisive outcome even when a candidate has only a plurality of the popular votes. This stability in our electoral process is essential for avoiding unnecessary delays and uncertainties.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system that ensures certainty of outcome, representative governance, informed voters, equitable representation of states, and simplicity in the electoral process. While it is not a perfect system, it has proven effective and should be preserved. I urge you to consider these arguments and advocate for the continued use of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

74,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Road transportation plays a major role in modern societies, yet overreliance on private vehicles comes with significant downsides. Limiting car use where possible can help address some pressing issues while benefiting both communities and the environment. 

One advantage of limiting car usage is improved public health. Automobiles contribute heavily to air pollution in cities through their exhaust emissions. Fine particulate matter and other pollutants emitted by vehicle tailpipes are linked to respiratory illnesses and early death. Reducing traffic volumes allows air to circulate and disperse pollutants more effectively. People would also walk, cycle or take public transit more, increasing physical activity levels and promoting fitness. 

Congestion is another problem partly caused by high numbers of individual drivers clogging road networks. Rush hours seem to get worse yearly as more cars crowd limited street space. Limiting private car trips through policies encouraging ride-sharing, working from home, and mass transit options could help ease traffic jams. This benefits not just commuters stressed over long delays but also local businesses relying on deliveries and customer access. Well-designed public transportation moves more people through the same corridors much more efficiently.

Financial savings represent another advantage. Driving is a costly proposition considering vehicle purchases, gas, maintenance, and insurance. Opting for alternate modes of transit where reasonable allows households to reduce transportation spending. Cities also benefit from lower road maintenance needs as there is less wear and tear from fewer vehicles. Funds no longer spent on expanding road capacity due to lower traffic can be reallocated to other priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a win-win through various societal and economic advantages while also helping address pressing environmental issues. Strong multi-modal transit and supportive policies can encourage behavioral changes empowering more people to opt out of carbon-intensive private automobiles when alternatives are made widely practical. A balanced, less car-centric approach to mobility can significantly benefit modern communities.",1,324
75,"I think driverless cars are a bad idea. I know lots of people are excited about it, but I don’t think it’s worth it. First, they’re expensive. Like, really expensive. The article says “the cost of a self-driving car is expected to be around $70,000 to $100,000.” That’s like, a whole lot of money! And it’s not like normal cars are super cheap either. I mean, my dad’s car cost like $30,000 and it’s not even that fancy.

Another thing is that driverless cars are gonna make a lot of people lose their jobs. The article says “self-driving cars could eliminate jobs for taxi drivers, truckers, and delivery drivers.” That’s like, a lot of people! And it’s not like they can just get a new job, it’s gonna be hard for them to find something else. My dad’s friend is a truck driver and he loves his job, he’s been doing it for like 20 years. It’d be really sad if he lost his job.

Also, driverless cars are gonna be really confusing for old people. The article says “older adults may have difficulty using the technology.” My grandma is like, really old and she already has a hard time using her phone. She’s always like “how do I send a text?” and stuff. It’d be really hard for her to use a driverless car.

I know some people think driverless cars are a good idea because they’ll be safer and stuff, but I don’t think it’s worth it. The article says “90% of accidents are caused by human error.” That’s a lot of accidents! But, like, what if the driverless car makes a mistake? It’s not like it can just, like, apologize and stuff. It’s gonna be a big mess. And what if it crashes into another car? That’s gonna be so dangerous!

In conclusion, driverless cars are a bad idea. They’re too expensive, they’ll make people lose their jobs, they’ll be confusing for old people, and they’re not even that safe. We should just stick with regular cars and make sure people are more careful when they drive.",1,350
76,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to recognize human emotions. As a grade 9 student, I find it fascinating that computers can now detect emotions similar to how humans do. However, the question remains whether using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. In this essay, I will argue that the use of FACS in the classroom is beneficial and has the potential to revolutionize education.

Firstly, FACS can help teachers identify students who may be struggling emotionally. In a typical classroom, it can be challenging for teachers to monitor the emotional well-being of each student. With FACS, teachers can quickly identify students who appear stressed, anxious, or disengaged. This early detection can enable teachers to provide necessary support and interventions, ultimately improving the student's academic performance and overall well-being. For instance, if a student is struggling with a particular concept, FACS can help the teacher identify the student's frustration and provide additional resources or tailored support to help them better understand the material.

Secondly, FACS can promote a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. In a diverse classroom, it can be challenging for teachers to cater to the unique needs and emotions of each student. FACS can help teachers identify students who may be feeling left out or marginalized, enabling them to take proactive steps to create a more inclusive environment. For example, if FACS detects that a student is feeling isolated or disconnected from the class, the teacher can encourage participation and engagement by asking targeted questions or providing additional support.

Thirdly, FACS can help students develop essential life skills, such as emotional intelligence and self-awareness. By using FACS, students can gain a better understanding of their emotions and learn how to manage them effectively. This skillset is crucial in today's society, where emotional intelligence is increasingly recognized as a key factor in personal and professional success. Moreover, FACS can encourage students to develop healthy coping mechanisms and stress management techniques, promoting their overall well-being and resilience.

However, it is important to acknowledge potential concerns regarding privacy and data security. Some students and parents may worry that FACS could infringe on their privacy or misuse their emotional data. To address these concerns, it is essential to ensure that FACS is implemented with robust privacy policies and data protection measures. Teachers and school administrators must be trained to handle sensitive data and maintain confidentiality, while also being transparent about how the data is used and shared.

In conclusion, the use of FACS in the classroom is a valuable tool that can revolutionize education. By identifying students who may be struggling emotionally, promoting a more inclusive learning environment, and helping students develop essential life skills, FACS can positively impact the academic performance and well-being of students. While privacy concerns must be addressed, the benefits of FACS far outweigh the potential drawbacks. As technology continues to advance, it is crucial that we harness its power to create a more supportive, inclusive, and effective learning environment for all students.",1,511
77,"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. In the passage set, there are examples of communities and cities that have implemented car-free policies and have experienced positive outcomes.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can play a part in reducing their carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog is a persistent problem, implementing car-free measures can significantly reduce air pollution. For example, after a five-day period of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Limiting car usage can help reduce the emissions of pollutants that contribute to smog and other respiratory problems.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, residents have reported feeling happier and less tense without the need for car ownership. Walking, biking, and using public transportation can contribute to a more active lifestyle and improve physical and mental well-being. It can also create a sense of community as people interact more while walking or cycling through the neighborhood.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient use of space and resources. In Vauban, for example, large garages at the edge of the development serve as the only parking spaces, minimizing the need for streets and driveways. This allows for more green and communal spaces within the community. The concept of limiting car usage also promotes smart planning, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street rather than in distant malls. This decreases the need for large parking areas and encourages a more compact and accessible community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, improved quality of life for individuals, and more efficient use of space and resources. Utilizing alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation can lead to a more sustainable and livable future. By implementing car-free policies and promoting smart planning, communities can contribute to a greener and healthier environment for everyone.",1,424
78,"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite the Risks

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthy scientific pursuit in spite of the planet's hazardous conditions. While exploring Venus presents clear dangers, the potential scientific rewards outweigh these risks. Three key pieces of evidence from the article support this assessment.

First, Venus shares many similarities to Earth that could deepen our understanding of how terrestrial planets develop. Venus and Earth are nearly the same size, and scientists believe their early histories may have been comparable as well. Venus likely had liquid water on its surface in the past. Comparing Venus and Earth could therefore yield valuable insights into planetary evolution and habitability. 

Second, Venus's current hellish environment holds clues about how a runaway greenhouse effect occurs. With surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, Venus offers a cautionary tale of what can happen when a planet's atmospheric dynamics go awry. Studying Venus could help identify positive feedback loops that trigger catastrophic warming, informing efforts to curb climate change on Earth.  

Third, advanced probes and technologies have mitigated many of the risks of exploring Venus. Landers can operate for hours on the surface using novel heat-resistant materials. Orbiters can gather important data without direct surface contact. While risks remain, carefully designed missions leverage modern engineering to overcome Venus's harsh conditions and open new possibilities for scientific study.

In conclusion, while exploring Venus poses real hazards, the potential rewards for advancing scientific understanding amply justify continued investigation of our neighboring world. By highlighting three ways Venus can provide uniquely valuable insights, the author makes a persuasive case that studying Venus remains a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Carefully crafted missions balancing safety and objectives can overcome Venus' challenges to reveal new discoveries about planetary processes relevant for Earth.",1,300
79,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in countries around the world to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to create more compact and accessible suburbs, decrease reliance on cars, and improve the overall quality of life for residents. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and have been observed in various communities across the globe.

One notable example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, except for a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. The absence of cars has significantly improved the quality of life for residents. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, expressed her happiness with the car-free lifestyle, stating, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This sentiment is shared by many residents who now enjoy the tranquility of verdant streets, filled with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children, rather than the noise and stress of cars.

Not only do car-free communities like Vauban provide a more peaceful living environment, but they also have a positive impact on the environment itself. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation options such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, these car-free communities significantly reduce emissions and combat climate change. The success of Vauban and other similar communities in reducing emissions highlights the effectiveness of limiting car usage in mitigating the harmful environmental effects of cars.

The advantages of limiting car usage are not limited to car-free communities. Cities like Paris have also implemented measures to reduce car usage, such as driving bans during periods of intense smog. Paris enforced a partial driving ban, requiring motorists with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home on certain days. This resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped clear the air of pollution. These temporary driving bans illustrate how limiting car usage can have an immediate positive impact on air quality and public health.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to improved urban planning and development. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, with sprawling developments and extensive parking spaces. However, smart planning advocates for more compact and accessible suburbs, with stores placed within walking distance and an emphasis on public transportation. This approach not only reduces the need for cars but also creates vibrant and sustainable communities. These walkable neighborhoods encourage physical activity, facilitate social interactions, and support local businesses.

Moreover, limiting car usage has the potential to shift cultural norms and improve overall well-being. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership, driving, and the percentage of young people getting driver's licenses. This shift in behavior can be attributed to various factors, such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of car-sharing programs. As people become less dependent on cars for their daily activities, they experience reduced stress, improved health, and increased mobility options.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and far-reaching. Car-free communities like Vauban demonstrate the positive impact of living without cars, from increased happiness and tranquility to reduced emissions and improved air quality. Temporary driving bans, as seen in Paris, also illustrate the immediate benefits of limiting car usage in combating pollution. Furthermore, smart planning initiatives that promote compact suburbs, alternative transportation options, and increased walkability have the potential to reshape communities and improve overall well-being. As more countries adopt measures to limit car usage, these advantages will continue to be realized, creating a more sustainable and enjoyable future for all.",1,683
80,"The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential election process. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, it is important to consider the benefits and practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, as outlined in various texts on the topic.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. Despite the occasional dispute, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures a clear and definitive victor, reducing the likelihood of extended disputes and potential political turmoil.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes a sense of inclusivity and representation for all regions of the country, as stated in Judge Posner's article. With no region having enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president, candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different states. This prevents a candidate with solely regional support from taking office and ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the system encourages candidates to focus on swing states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. This prompts them to engage deeply with voters in these states and increases the likelihood that they will listen to the concerns and needs of these citizens. It also encourages swing state voters to pay closer attention to campaigns, making them more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process.

Judge Posner's article also highlights the importance of the Electoral College in giving weight to the political balance of larger states. While the Senate's malapportionment may lead to smaller states having a stronger voice in Congress, the Electoral College helps mitigate this imbalance. It ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates, as they have a higher number of electoral votes.

Finally, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for run-off elections, as discussed in Judge Posner's article. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, it ensures that a clear winner emerges and avoids the complexities and costs associated with run-off elections.

I understand that there are valid concerns about the fairness and potential disenfranchisement of voters in states with little chance of swinging the election. However, as pointed out in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the role of individual voters is not to directly elect the president, but to vote for a slate of electors who will represent their interests. Additionally, almost half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, demonstrating that individuals are motivated to express their political preference, even if their vote alone may not significantly impact the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-tested process that has ensured stability, representation, and a clear outcome in our presidential elections. While changes may be proposed, it is essential to carefully consider the benefits of the current system and the potential consequences of altering it. I urge you, as my duly elected representative, to continue supporting the preservation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your continued service to our great state.

Sincerely,

81,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place. While there are valid arguments against it, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" I find the points made by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" to be more convincing.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the outcome can still occur, they are less likely than in a direct popular vote system. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral vote victory for even a slight plurality in a state. This helps provide a clearer and more decisive outcome.

Another important factor in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. As Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters across different regions. This is crucial for a successful president, as it helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also ensures that residents from all regions feel represented and that their interests are taken into account.

The focus on swing states is another positive aspect of the Electoral College. Posner argues that the winner-take-all system incentivizes candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on the states that are more evenly divided, known as swing states. These states receive more attention from candidates, which leads to a more engaged and informed electorate in these crucial states. This allows for a more thoughtful decision-making process and ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election.

The Electoral College also helps balance the influence of large and small states. As Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives more weight to small states in terms of representation. The Electoral College helps to restore some balance by providing larger states with more electoral votes. This means that presidential candidates must consider the interests and concerns of voters in both large and small states, preventing the majority from completely overshadowing the minority.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This is another advantage highlighted by Posner. In such cases, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner, reducing the need for additional elections and potential complications in the presidential election process.

In conclusion, while the arguments against the Electoral College presented by Bradford Plumer are valid, I believe that the advantages described by Judge Richard A. Posner outweigh the shortcomings. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters, ensures the representation of different regions, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for keeping the Electoral College in place.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

82,"Favoring the Preservation of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are those who argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several benefits that should be considered before any changes are made.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As Judge Richard Posner points out in his article, ""Certainty of Outcome,"" the winner-take-all system in each state ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, as the outcome is more definitive. Furthermore, the Electoral College system makes it highly unlikely for a nationwide electoral tie to occur, as the even number of total votes increases the chances of a clear victor.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is everyone's president. In his article, Judge Posner highlights that no single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must appeal to a wide range of regions and demographics in order to secure victory. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College promotes a sense of national representation and prevents candidates with only regional appeal from becoming president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, as explained by Judge Posner in his piece, ""Swing States."" This means that voters in these states, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully consider their choices, have a considerable impact on the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to tailor their policies and messages to address the concerns of these swing states, ultimately ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the ability to decide the election.

The Electoral College also offers specific advantages to large states. As Judge Posner argues in his article, ""Big States,"" the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In the Electoral College system, a large state like Florida, with a close popular vote, receives a significant number of electoral votes. This incentivizes candidates to pay more attention to large states during their campaigns, ensuring that the concerns of these populous states are adequately represented.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As mentioned by Judge Posner in his article, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections,"" in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and additional costs associated with run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its certainty of outcome, ability to ensure that the president is everyone's president, focus on swing states, representation of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections all contribute to a fair and balanced system. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides significant advantages that should not be overlooked.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to the strengths of the Electoral College and its impact on our democratic processes.

83,"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial and fair method of ensuring a balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election process.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a popular vote and electing the President by a vote in Congress. As outlined in The Office of the Federal Register's text, the process consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, as well as the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election, with the number of electors being directly proportional to the state's representation in Congress.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because a winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state also leads to a landslide electoral vote victory, giving a clear indication of the people's choice.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected, promoting a president who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Additionally, swing states play a significant role in the electoral process, attracting candidates to campaign and engage with voters in those states. This results in more thoughtful voters who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, consequently making an informed decision.

Another vital aspect is that the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution between large and small states. As Judge Posner indicates, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. This consideration for both large and small states is crucial for maintaining a fair and equal representation of all Americans in the electoral process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the potential complications associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may limit voter participation in states where a particular candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to emphasize that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences, as Judge Posner highlights. The continuation of the Electoral College recognizes the reality that no single vote will swing a national election and that voters participate to have their voices heard, regardless of the electoral outcome in their state.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains an essential system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a fair representation of all citizens, guarantees a clear and decisive outcome, and maintains balance between large and small states. While recognizing the need for improvements in our electoral process, I firmly believe that abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles on which it was established. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our current system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the benefits of the Electoral College and the potential consequences of abandoning it. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

Yours sincerely,

84,"(Introduction)

The Face on Mars is a fascinating topic that has been debated by many individuals for years. However, there are those who believe that the Face was created by aliens. As a scientist at NASA, I have studied the Face extensively and have found that it is actually just a natural landform. In this essay, I will provide evidence to support this claim and argue that the Face is not a creation of aliens.

(Body)

Firstly, it is important to understand that the Face on Mars was first discovered by a Viking spacecraft in 1976. The image captured by the spacecraft was of poor quality and only showed a small portion of the area. This caused people to believe that the Face was a creation of intelligent life forms. However, later images captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007 showed the area in much greater detail, revealing that the Face was just a natural landform.

Additionally, scientists have studied the geology and topography of the area and have found that the Face was most likely formed by natural processes such as erosion and wind. The area is made of sand dunes, and the shape of the Face is consistent with the surrounding landscape. This indicates that the Face was not created by aliens, but rather by the natural forces of the planet.

(Conclusion)

In conclusion, it is clear that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens. The evidence provided by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the study of the area's geology and topography support this claim. While the idea of aliens creating the Face is intriguing, it is important to rely on evidence and scientific research when making claims about the universe. As a scientist at NASA, I believe that it is my duty to provide accurate information and to dispel myths and misconceptions about space exploration.",1,316
85,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1,475
86,"Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing as a concerned student and citizen to express my viewpoint on the ongoing debate about the Electoral College system employed for presidential elections. After considering multiple perspectives, I maintain that we should adopt direct election by popular vote, ensuring the principles of democracy are upheld.

The founding fathers developed the Electoral College as a compromise to balance power between the Congress and the ordinary citizens (Office of the Federal Register, Passage 1). This system, however, has proven itself outmoded and unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer asserts, the Electoral College ends up with candidates spending majority of their campaign time focusing solely on the ‘swing’ states while neglecting states where they perceive little chance of winning (Passage 13). This unfairly distorts the electoral process in favor of certain states and voters, which contravenes the principles of equality espoused in a democratic society.

The flaws in the Electoral College system are rampant. As noted in Passage 11, faithless electors, potential electoral ties, and the ""disaster factor"" underscore its imperfections. It is alarming how easily electors can defy the will of the people and how an electoral tie can undermine the popular choice.

While supporters, such as Judge Richard Posner, advocate for the Electoral College citing reasons like certainty of outcome, favoring widespread appeal for candidates, and avoiding runoff elections (Passages 18-22), I argue that these benefits could still exist in a direct popular voting system. If no candidate achieves an outright majority, we could implement a runoff between the top candidates. Furthermore, the importance of “trans-regional appeal” and focusing on electoral votes in large states can still be relevant even under a popular vote system.

A switch to a direct popular vote would mean that every American’s vote has equal impact. It reorients the focus of campaigns to all citizens, not just those in ‘swing’ states. Additionally, given how often the winner of the popular vote does not actually win the presidency due to the Electoral College, it cultivates a sense of disenfranchisement among voters. 

Democracy is the power of the people, and we should strive to ensure that power is distributed equally among everyone, not just a select few states or voters deemed to be in strategic locations. Abolishing the Electoral College and adopting a direct popular voting system is a necessary reform. It not only upholds the spirit of democracy but also gives credence to the 'one citizen, one vote' principle.

Thank you for your valuable time, and I hope the points raised will serve as food for thought. 

Yours sincerely,

87,"Dear Senator [LastName],

I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen and constituent to express my opinion on a critical matter central to our democracy: the Electoral College. I have been researching this topic thoroughly, reading sources from various perspectives, and would like to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College in our system of electing the President.

I acknowledge the arguments of some critics of the Electoral College, like Bradford Plumer, who suggest it is an outdated and unfair system because it discourages candidates from campaigning in states they either secure or have no chance of winning, reducing the attention paid to numerous Americans' political concerns. Indeed, the possibility of an electoral tie—a scenario where the presidency would be decided by the House of Representatives, introducing a further level of disconnect between the popular vote and the presidential election—is also an alarming prospect.

Yet, the arguments in support of the Electoral College are compelling. As noted by the judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College challenges presidential candidates to appeal not just to dense population centers or specific regions, but to a broad, diverse, and geographically representative cross-section of the United States. Gaining the approval of such a diverse populace is a testament to any leader's aptitude and worthiness of the role.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a degree of certainty in the outcome. The winner-take-all system, while it has its critics, means that a close popular vote is often reflected as a more decisive electoral victory, which can lessen the likelihood of disputes following the election. This contributes to the peaceful transition of power that has traditionally been a hallmark of our democratic system.

Furthermore, the Electoral College mechanism balances the representation of large and small states. It compensates for the inequitable distribution within the Senate and increases the political influence of smaller states, bolstering the federalist principle of equal state representation alongside representation proportionate to population.

Interestingly, under the current system, it is improbable that a presidential candidate could win with only a plurality rather than a majority of votes, which would necessitate burdensome run-off elections.

I acknowledge that the process of the Electoral College might seem confusing and less democratic to some, but according to Judge Posner, potential voters are those who express political preferences rather than those who assume their vote would singularly determine an election. With the right adjustments, the system can serve to promote a president directly representative of the nation's complex demographics.

I pause to urge you, Senator, to take these considerations under advisement as you shape policy in this domain. An educated, comprehensive discussion about electoral college reform is needed for the preservation and furthering of our democratic values. 

Thank you for your time, and your continued dedication to our state.

Sincerely,

88,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Global Perspective 

The accelerating global shift towards limiting car usage, inspired by a variety of socio-economic and environmental reasons, provides numerous advantages to society. By analyzing case studies from Germany, Colombia, France, and the United States, this paper highlights the rationale and benefits behind this movement. 

Vauban, a German suburb accentuates the essence of a low-car suburbia experiencing the benefits of “smart planning” (Rosenthal). Prohibiting street parking and home garages has created a car-free society where 70% of the families do not own cars, hence creating quieter, safer, and greener community spaces (Rosenthal). Moreover, this urban planning model aids in drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, with personal vehicles contributing to 12%-50% of these emissions in Europe and certain regions in the U.S., respectively (Rosenthal). 

Paris demonstrates an impactful relationship between car usage and air quality. After enforcement of a partial driving ban following days of near-record pollution, Paris experienced a significant 60% reduction in congestion and a visible decline in smog levels (Duffer). Thus, restricting car usage can rapidly improve overall air quality, augmenting the health benefits for the whole community.

Bogota’s initiative of “Day Without Cars” greatly reduced smog levels and allowed citizens to appreciate alternative modes of transport, a demonstration that even temporary suspension of car usage can substantially improve air quality and advocate sustainable transportation (Selsky). 

Meanwhile in the United States, a combination of societal changes and higher public consciousness about the environmental impact of cars is leading towards an ""End of Car Culture"" (Rosenthal). The advent of carpooling apps, the increase in telecommuting, and the rise in both bicycling and walking for commuting are putting less cars on the road (Rosenthal). Moreover, as younger generations are reportedly less interested in obtaining a driver's license or owning a car, this shift is expected to persist and potentially accelerate, further reducing overall carbon emissions (Rosenthal). 

These case studies highlight the beneficial implications of limiting car usage, ranging from reduced emissions, better air quality, healthier communities, as well as a shift towards sustainable practices amongst future generations. By following Vauban's example, and incorporating tactics used by Paris and Bogota, cities globally can effectively deal with pollution related problems and create sustainable, healthier societies. Lester Brown, an environmental analyst, once said: “We have not inherited the Earth from our forefathers—we are borrowing it from our children”, hence, the shift towards limiting car usage is not merely essential—it’s imperative.

91,"The Benefits of Driverless Cars Outweigh the Risks

While the development of driverless cars presents both opportunities and challenges, their potential benefits make them worthwhile to pursue. According to the article, these autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce accidents caused by human error, the major cause of many car crashes today. By removing the human element of poor judgment from driving, we have an opportunity to make our roads far safer. 

Driverless cars also promise to improve mobility for many. The elderly and disabled, who struggle to drive themselves, would gain new independence with autonomous taxis or shuttle services. Children and others unable to legally drive could still access self-driving cars. For those who cannot or prefer not to drive, this expansion of transportation options has tremendous value.

Of course, introducing widespread driverless technology introduces adjustments and uncertainties. As the article notes, hackers represent a risk if they manage to break into autonomous driving systems. However, with responsible development and cybersecurity best practices, we can minimize these cyber risks to an acceptable level. Additionally, while some jobs like taxi and truck driving may decline, new industries and professions will emerge to support and maintain the autonomous vehicles that serve as a basis for future mobility services.

In conclusion, the coming of driverless cars presents an opportunity to make our roads dramatically safer while expanding access to transportation. With prudent development and oversight to ensure cybersecurity and address uncertainties, the benefits of autonomous vehicles clearly outweigh the risks. Overall, the introduction of driverless car technology has the potential to save many lives and improve mobility for all. We should welcome and support this promising transportation development.",1,274
92,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Explanatory Essay

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable forms of transportation. This movement recognizes that the dependence on cars in suburban areas is a major obstacle to achieving these goals. By adopting smart planning principles and creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, we can enjoy several advantages, including reduced emissions, improved quality of life, and a stronger sense of community.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article in the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. For example, in the car-free community of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This reduction in car ownership has led to a noticeable decrease in emissions and a cleaner environment for the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is an improved quality of life for residents. Rosenthal describes how the residents of Vauban, Germany, have more peaceful and less stressful lives since giving up their cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now she is much happier. Without the noise and pollution of cars, the streets in Vauban are filled with the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children. This car-free environment provides a more tranquil and enjoyable living experience for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can strengthen the sense of community in suburban areas. In the past, suburbs have been built around car ownership, with houses spread out and connected by extensive road networks. This type of development isolates residents and makes it difficult to interact with neighbors. However, by adopting the principles of smart planning and creating car-free communities, we can encourage more interaction and socialization among residents. In the new approach, stores are placed within walking distance, and public transportation becomes more accessible. This creates a sense of connectivity and encourages people to interact with their neighbors. As David Goldberg of Transportation for America states, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers several advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, and fostering a sense of community, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment. It is crucial that we continue to explore and implement smart planning principles in order to promote car-free communities and reduce our dependence on cars. As the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show, this movement is already gaining traction and has the potential to make a significant impact on our society.",1,514
93,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has been a growing trend in cities around the world, with numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative transportation methods. By reducing car usage, cities can address issues like greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from various sources.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and using alternative modes of transport, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, cities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. Rosenthal mentions that automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, leading to increased traffic on roads. By adopting a ""smart planning"" approach and creating more compact communities with better accessibility to public transportation, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen 57 percent of its residents sell their cars and 70 percent of families not owning cars, resulting in less traffic and a more peaceful and sustainable living environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality and public health. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it is mentioned that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. Cold nights and warm days caused a layer of warmer air to trap car emissions, leading to smog and poor air quality. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative transportation methods, cities can reduce air pollution, decrease respiratory problems, and improve overall public health.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more vibrant and livable communities. Andrew Selsky highlights in his article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" that car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, have resulted in empty streets and improved quality of life. With fewer cars on the roads, people have more opportunities to walk, bike, and interact with others. This shift in transportation culture can lead to the creation of pedestrian-friendly spaces, better urban design, and the promotion of community interaction.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating more vibrant communities, cities can become more sustainable and livable. While there are challenges and adjustments associated with limiting car usage, it is clear that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. As the trend towards reducing car reliance continues to grow, more cities around the world can embrace smart planning and develop into thriving, environmentally-friendly communities.",1,511
94,"Introduction:

The Face on Mars is a famous feature that has sparked controversy and debate among scientists and the public for years. While some people believe that it was created by aliens, others argue that it is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens.

Body:

Firstly, the Face on Mars is not a unique feature on the planet. There are many other similar features on Mars that resemble faces, animals, and other objects. The Face is just one of many natural landforms that have been shaped by geological processes over millions of years.

Secondly, the Face on Mars is not a perfect representation of a face. If it were created by aliens, it would be expected to be perfectly symmetrical and proportional. However, the Face is distorted and asymmetrical, which is consistent with natural geological formations.

Thirdly, the Face on Mars has been studied extensively by NASA and other space agencies, and no evidence of intelligent life has been found on the planet. If aliens did exist on Mars, they would have left behind some evidence of their presence, such as buildings, tools, or other artifacts.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens. The evidence from the article supports this claim, and it is important to rely on scientific evidence and not speculation when making claims about the universe. While it is exciting to think about the possibility of life beyond Earth, we must be careful not to jump to conclusions without evidence.",1,271
95,"Using Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom could provide some benefits but also raises serious privacy and ethical concerns. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are responding to lessons on an individual level. If a teacher knows that most students seem confused or bored during a particular part of a lesson, for example, they could adjust their teaching approach to improve comprehension. The technology could also help identify students who are struggling emotionally but might not speak up, so that teachers could check in and offer support. 

However, constantly monitoring students' facial expressions against their will would be an invasion of privacy that could undermine trust in the learning environment. Students should feel free to experience a full range of emotions without every reaction being recorded and analyzed. There are also concerns about misinterpreting facial cues or making assumptions without understanding the full context of students' lives. Labels based on facial scans could potentially do more harm than good if not used sensitively and ethically. 

Overall, while this technology offers potential benefits if used judiciously, the risks to student privacy and well-being are serious factors that need to be weighed. More discussion is needed around establishing guidelines for informed consent, data privacy, and ensuring the technology supplements but does not replace human judgment from teachers who know their students. Unless such issues are addressed comprehensively, the downsides of non-consensual emotional profiling may outweigh any advantages in most classroom applications.",1,256
96,"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Trends

With the increasing concerns surrounding climate change, pollution, global health, and an overall desire for more sustainable living, societies worldwide are re-evaluating one of the most distinguishing aspects of modern life: car usage. This essay aims to discuss the potential advantages that limitation or even cessation of car usage can bring about by examining real-world examples from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France and Bogotá, Colombia. 

In the German suburb of Vauban, Rosenthal (2009) gives us a glimpse of what a low-car suburb can look like and how its residents thrive without individual vehicle dependence - a lifestyle that just might be the answer to the threat of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution worldwide. The measures taken in Vauban led to 70% of its population giving up car ownership. Furthermore, it shed light on an unexpected advantage: increased peace of mind. A resident confessed leading a much happier life without the constant stress of maintaining and using a car (Rosenthal, 2009).

A partial ban enforced in Paris successfully decreased air pollution and respiratory health hazards by a significant measure, reducing congestion by 60% and bringing under control smog levels which had been akin to highly polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer, 2014). However, it’s important to note the resistance faced by some, as seen in the case of 4000 drivers fined for violation of the ban, suggesting that behavioral and cultural shifts would be an essential part of this transformation.

In Colombia, car-free days have become a cardinal part of public policy, promoting alternative transportation methods, and reducing smog, while massively improving public health. The public participation, as seen in Bogota, suggests better acceptance of such policies, especially when bolstered with improvements in pedestrian spaces and community zones (Selsky, 2002).

In the United States too, an interesting trend has emerged with newer generations driving less, buying fewer cars, and acquiring fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This cultural shift is indicative of the potential for reduced car-usage, especially when combined with effective policy measures. 

As we move ahead, it's crucial to understand the success of reduced car-reliance isn’t only about changing our transportation choices, but also about reconsidering how we envision our communities. “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg (Rosenthal, 2009). The successful transformation of Vauban, the car-free days of Bogotá, the temporary car ban in Paris, and America's changing driving trends all testify to the feasibility and tangible benefits of a reduced-car world. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely an environmental issue, but a pathway to sustainable living, improved public health, community building, and rejuvenation of urban spaces. Acceptance and implementation of this change would necessarily involve combined efforts from government, city planners, and citizens. The transition might pose challenges but the benefits are valuable and far-reaching. Redefining mobility holds immense promise for our future.",1,493

I just red an artycle about this gye named Luke who rode the waves on a ship! He wuz part of this thing called the Seagoing Cowboys program and got to see so meny cool things! I think you should join to!

First off, the Seagoing Cowboys program is super cool because it lets you ride on a ship and visit diffrent contries. Luke got to go to Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republican! That's so meny different places! And he got to ride on a ship the whole time, which is like a big adventure!

Another cool thing about the program is that you get to help people. Luke helped deliver animals to people who needed them for their farms and stuff. That's so nice! And you get to learn all about taking care of animals too.

Also, the program is good because it's not just about sitting in a classroom all day. You get to be outside and see the world. Luke got to see dolphins and whales in the ocean! Who knows what other cool things you'll see?

So, if you want to have cool adventures, help people, and see the world, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! It's a once in a lifetime thing and you wont regret it!

98,"Hi, my name is Jocelyn and I am in grade 9. Today I wanna talk about that new facial thingy that can read peoples emotions. Like it said in the article, computers can use it to see if we are happy, sad, or whatever. Some people think its cool but I am not sure.

So, like, in a classroom, they can use this thing to see if we are paying attention or if we are bored. That could be good, I guess. It could help teachers know when to change the lesson or something. But, what if we are just naturally expressionless? Like, I have a resting bitch face, so does that mean I am always bored or mad? No, it just means my face doesn't move much.

And, like it said in the article, computers can use it to read job candidates emotions to see if they are a good fit. That is messed up. What if someone is nervous but would be a great employee? It's not fair to judge someone just based on their face.

I don't think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms. It could make people feel self-conscious and it's not a true way to measure how people feel. We should focus on actually asking people how they feel instead of relying on a computer program.

I strongly disagree with the idea that it's valuable to use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. We should focus more on building relationships and having human interactions rather than relying on technology to do that for us.

That's my opinion, what do you guys think?

99,"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential election process. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College better serves our democratic principles and safeguards against potential issues that may arise with a direct election.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcomes. With the winner-takes-all system in place, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the results of the election are less likely to be disputed compared to a purely popular vote system, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College minimizes the chances of a nationwide tie, which would require a run-off election and complicate the process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region in our country has a voice in the election. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns and interests of less populated rural areas. By requiring candidates to appeal to different regions, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president. This ensures that the elected president is ""everyone's president,"" taking into account the diverse needs and interests of the entire nation.

The swing state phenomenon also highlights the significance of the Electoral College. In a popular vote system, candidates would predominantly concentrate on large population states, disregarding the concerns and perspectives of smaller states. The winner-takes-all method employed by the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states where the election outcome is uncertain. This encourages candidates to engage with voters from a variety of states and ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are eager to listen and consider different perspectives, play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College preserves the political balance for larger states. The apportionment of Senate seats grants small states a proportionally larger influence than their population size would warrant, compensating for the potential imbalance caused. The Electoral College further accentuates this balance, as larger states receive more attention from candidates, both in terms of campaigning and addressing regional issues. This ensures that the presidential election process accommodates the interests and concerns of both small and large states, promoting a fair and equal representation.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, the process remains streamlined and preserves the stability and effectiveness of our democratic system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states dominated by one party, leading to voter apathy, it is essential to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences. Additionally, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of contested elections and guarantees that voters' voices are respected, irrespective of the state's political leanings.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in ensuring certainty of outcomes, promoting regional representation, encouraging candidates to engage with swing states, maintaining political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. It fosters a fair and democratic election process that takes into account the diverse needs and interests of our nation. I respectfully urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and to support its continuation in our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,614
