0,"We as people want to explore to new levels that no one has ever been to. Some of those things could be going to Venus. You would be the first person to go, everyone would love you, and you would get so much fame. Here's some things that you don't know about. It's exreamly dangerous and your chances of survival and very slim. By slim I mean next to none.

The planet is 97% carbon dixoide so we wouldn't be able to breath and you have have to be in a space suit with limited oxygen supply. Next, you wouldn't be able to touch the surface considering that the average temperatures and 800 degress fahrenheit. When you're there you won't be able to collect materails such as rocks, gases, or even anything else because you won't be able to get to there surface and anything you use to try to touch the surface will melt.

When you are there you will be experiencing 90 times more atompheric pressure than you would here on earth. It would literally crush you to be present on the surface of Venus. Not to mention you could be the second fatherist away from earth and that'll make it longer to get back to earth than normal. Also, when you are there the planet is rotating faster than it would on earth and make you very sick.

So, before you decide to make big leaps and explore new places you got to know what you can and can't do. The author from the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gave me my information and did an amazing job explaining and getting me to understand how harse Venus could really be. You are limited to far heights and it's your choice to find them.",0,297,6,7.203868227424749,7,197.3958004639823
1,"Cars are an essential part of life; they get us from place A to place B, but so do bikes, buses, trains, and your very own feet. In Vauban, Germany, residents have gone where few soccer moms or communting executives have ever gone: they have given up there cars. ""Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers."" (Rosenthal 1) In a world filled with pollution, stressed adults, and unhealthy people the advantages of limiting car usage are infinite.

Limiting car usage in the world would most definitely reduce the amount of pollution that is ruining our ozone layer. If it wasn't for the ozone layer humans would be long gone and wouldn't come back any time soon. In Paris, France, the goverment enforced a partial driving ban because of the near-record pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even - numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" (Duffer, 11) After five days of partial driving, congestion was down an incredible 60 percent. What if after five days they kept going? The city would look and feel brand knew and it would be safe for citizens  to breathe the air.  Similarily, our very own President Obama is trying to curb the United Sates' greenhouse gas emissions. "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" (Rosenthal 32) This means that people are choosing better ways to get from place A to place B, and if this trend persists "".. it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" (Rosenthal 34) As you can see, there is hard eveidence that limiting car usage in the world would reduce the amount of pollution.

Furthermore, limiting car usage would help to relieve the stress of our everyday lives. How much traffic will there be? Am I going to get to work on time? Oh my god, I am out of gas and I passed the nearest gas station? Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the car-free Vauban, Germany, says,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Also, the stress levels of adults get higher when they become parents who have children driving. I know my mom doesn't sit through a full car ride with me without stomping on her imaginary brakes. But, it seems to be that, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a license.."" (Rosenthal 38) Moreover, even one day without driving makes the Columbians in Bogota, Columbia, less stressed and more relaxed. Business man Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two-seat bicycle wih his wife to work that day. He says, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air-pollution."" (Selsky 24) Limiting car usage, like these small cities have done, helped to relieve stress of their citizens which is why it is a huge advantage.

Lastly, limiting car usage would better the well being of our fellow citizens. Imagine, a business man who works in an office for 10 hours and then gets home just in time to eat and catch a few hours of quality television. When does this man have time to exercise? He sits in his car, sits at work, sits to eat, and sits to watch tv. If we limited car usage, this man would have to ride his bike or walk to the bus stop to get to work everyday, which is good for his health. Similarily, we have children who spend more time in front of a computer screen than playing outside like children should. But, what parent would let there kids play outside when there's tons of cars on the road? In Vauban, Gemrany, the streets are filled with bicylcles and the chatter of wandering children beacuse there are no cars to be afraid of. Limiting car usage can better the well being of oursleves and everybody around us.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage in the world today. On every sidewalk, you would find relaxed and healthy people breathing clean and healthy air. We can create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources , lower emissions and improve safety."" We will never achieve a perfect world but it is not romantic or naive to work towards one.",0,761,20,8.891516735523641,9,495.4030408056718
2,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.",0,423,4,8.943200483403158,9,329.18286411156237
3,"Dear, Senator I'am a conserend voter that believes you should represent the people of your party and should apose the electoral college. It causes an unnecessary complication for voting for who will represent the face of the best country on earth. We the people do not want to get the wrong president to represent the majority of the population. The chances of an undefined out come through electoral college may be low but when it comes down to the presidency nothing should be left to chance.

The voters should know how the system of voting for president. They are the ones that decide so they should know how there vote can be used to have the greatest affect. Bradford Plumer states ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate...sometimes"". A democracy is when the people decide the destiny of there country. For them not to know what there chosing takes power out of the hands of the people.

The Winnertakesall system is ok when your on the playground as a childs it does not work in the real world. This system creates Swing States. according to Richard A. Posner ""method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states"". This draws attention away from other states. Bradford Plumer explained that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"". He also clames ""putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio"". This is not right each vote should be just as important as another and no state should be the deciding outcome in an election.

Chance is a crazy thing. If there is a chance of something happening and it's given time it will happen. A number of weird outcomes can happen with electoral college. One outcome is the possibility of having a tie. Richard A. Posner explains""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number"". If a tie happens the represenetives vote for the people and because each state has one vote per electoral college...""55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon voters."". Second posible out come is the majority vote goes to one canadite and the electoral college goes to the other. For example Bradford Plumer wrote""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" These are just two of the odd outcomes of electoral colleges could cause.

Electoral college don't solve problems but creat them. The best way to put it is this...""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are most assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.",0,472,2,8.400496357063403,9,312.238315125

5,"Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools because of its flexible learning and the ability to read the students.

In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, ""'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'"" With FACS, every child could essentially have a customized lesson plan exactly for their needs. This would make children more eager to learn because they begin to enjoy it. Besides the classroom, FACS could also be used in the school elsewhere. One of the other important areas this could be used is in counceling.

It is very hard for anyone to tell someone they are sad. This is especally true when they barely know the person they are talking to. This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help. With FACS, the school could see if children are upset or scared. The school could also see how often these children feel this way. When a child is unhappy or scared, it is very unlikely that they are going to be doing their work at full capacity. If FACS could find these children that need help, they could be helped faster. This could also be used to find children being bullied. If the child is feeling scared around another student, or if a child is afraid of a classroom, they could be helped because FACS was able to read them. FACS may even be able to detect if a child is afraid of leaving school. With FACS, it's like every child in school has someone that is looking out for them, even if no one else is. It may be true that some children might not want people to know about this, that they may want to hide it. However, it is never healthy to hide such strong emotions, especally if there are people around you willing to help.

With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.",0,634,2,7.295276275430361,7,489.90011476726517
6,"The author of this article is only focused on one thing in this article. They describe all of these reasons on why traveling to Venus is unsafe yet completely ignores his own reasoning by replacing it with an unrealistic claim stating that astronomers want to explore it. Also, while they explain the density is the same and how Venus is ""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"","" they bypass the subject of how much will it cost, how it will affect the United States as a whole.

The author is failing to realise just how unsafe it is to actually go to Venus. They do go on to talk about the ""electronis made of silicon carbide,"" but it doesnt change the fact that we could not survive eight hundred degree wheather and neither could a space ship. the space carrier would melt when it came into the orbit of Venus. Also if the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide is it really safe for anyone to go there. On Earth, we have a lot of pollution and a vast amount of carbon in the air but it is nowhere near the percentage in the article. Then you have a atmospheric pressure of ninety times more than our own. The article describes how that would crush a submarine that has been made to search the lowest points of the ocean. The article states in paragraph three, ""Also noteable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking land on its surface.""

The author is not taking into account the people who would need to go on this mission as well. We are talking about a human that if they were to get past the spot where they are orbiting that they will be faced with all of these horific obstacles. The lightning strikes would try to kill anyone who tries to find land on the surfac, yet they are trying to send people to find out about their curiosities? Are we okay with that? All of these factors will end up in a loss of a human if we try to step foot on Venus and that is not worth the curiosity of a few.

Attempting to go to Venus would be extremely costly and would be a very poor choice on our part in the long run. We are talking about putting a group of people and equipment that cost billions to trillions of dollars on a space exploration that has a vast possibility of not coming home. It would cost us a fortune and no onewould gain from it. Hypothetically, let's say the the craft landed, what are they going to have to face to get a rock and gas sample? The volcanoes, lightning strikes, and powerful earthquakes would kill everything and everyone on board before the can let out a sigh of relief. Venus may have been an Earth-like planet but as of right now, no one would benefit from an exploration there.

Venus can remain a mystery. The author writing this article is not thinking about the good for everyone and/or the possibility of it even becoming a reality. The whole article is flawed because even though we are alike in size and occasionally distance, no one has survived the landing for a reason. The planet is too dangerous for us to even think about trying to explore, so we will wait to see if factors change but for now the author wrote this article poorly. We are not ready at this point in time and we may never be but the curiosity of a few are not worth the risks.",0,638,15,7.9702208791208795,9,382.3259226250701
7,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a very beneficial group. I am Luke Bomberger, and

I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is a job opportunity to help take care of animals that are shipped off to other countries that were left in ruins. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I helped others, took care of animals, and got to go to places all over the world.

The Seagoing Cowboy program has people taking care of animals such as horses young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. When I worked overseas as a Seagoing Cowboy, I served as a watchman on my second trip. On the boat, I checked the animals every hour, and I cracked my ribs. Even though I got hurt, it was a good experience to work on a boat with animals. Along with helping others, you get to see many other esqusite places. I got to see parts of Europe and China, but the most special place I got to see was the Acropolis in Greece. It was also special when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. And these are just a few of the amazing places I've visited! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot of work, but it sure is a lot of fun, seeing and learning things from all over the world.

How did I become a Seagoing Cowboy, you asked? Well, my friend Don Reist invited me to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe, and I couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a lifetime. In Europe, we heard about the UNRRA hiring people to take care of the livestock that was to be shipped to other countries. Don and I signed up. This decision changed my life forever. After I signed up, I got to do many things. That is my story of becomoing a Seagoing Cowboy, and now it's your turn to become one.

Now that you all know about my experience, come and see for yourself how great it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are lots of fun things to do, and lots to learn! Have an adventurous time being a Seagoing Cowboy!",0,366,26,7.105511625794732,9,262.83783668844507
8,"Do you ever wonder why the world is becoming so much warmer by the minute? Not many people stop and realize what's the real problem. Us humans are the major problem in this situation, we don't see that we are taking what we have to an advantage. To our factories, cars, or even trash. The main one that is causing our greenhouse gases to rise is our Power plants, but following behind the power plants are vehicles. Cars have become a major impact in our lives, from hurting one another, to hurting the place we live on. Car-free cities are going to help make a big, helpful change in peoples lives.

In the city of Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Vauban is called a ""car-free"" place, cars aren't allowed on the streets of vauban. Many people sold their cars to live in vauban, all around vauban wants a healthy way of living. Vauban allows car ownership, but the cars are only to be parked in two places which are the garages. ""When I had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter said. It is a much healthier and less stressful way of living, new ideas will always come in handy. The United States Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car Reduced"" communities. Hopefully they get someone to tag along with this promotion, and get supporters to enforce it.

Bogota, Colombia is going on their third straight year of a ""Car Free"" city. They are wanting to reduce smog, so buses and taxis are permitted. ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo claimed. There was a consequence to the ones who didn't follow the rules, which was a $25 fine that they had to pay each time. Eventually, Two other Cities in Colombia, Cali and Valledupar, latched on to the idea of a ""Car reduction."" You see many people walking, running, riding bikes or skateboarding. A lot of people like this new idea that people are going by,  it's an great way to step foward to save the earth and its problems.

Over time, Americans haven't been buying cars, driving less, and over years less people get their license. America is hitting its driving peak, The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and then decreased signifigantly since then. Not many can afford a brand new car, or the insurance, most people are unemployed and dont work at all. Cars have been around for a long time, but over that time period it has caused major life impacting issues. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said mimi sheller. Many people aren't aware of this ""Car Free"" idea, which is an disadvantage.  If this idea was spread through televison, newspapers, or even social media many people will pick it up and take it into consideration.

In an overall sum up, it is better to live ""Car Free."" You wouldn't have to stress yourself out about gas prices, fixing your cars, or your world becoming a big ball of heat. If Transportation and power plants are the two major impacts in our lives, we need to knock one out. Until, we can get some second options on power plants our best choice is to forbid cars. We have many other options to get around our city, running, walking, riding bikes or etc. The ""Car Free"" idea is very creative, not many people would take inisuative to help make the world a better and safer place. With an exception of a few, buses and taxis will be there for long distance trips. Cars caused a huge impact on our lives, but hurting us and our home which we call earth. The business plan is ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey."" Think of all the advantages cars have given, but think about all of the disadvantages the cars have showed. Which one out weighs the other? Cars aren't always there to help us, life is all about choices, it's time to make yours.",0,704,23,7.6838782632002145,9,421.19829059482186
9,"Some people may think that the Face is not a natural landform but I am here to give you reasons why the Face IS a natural landform. The reasons I am going to give you are going to be in the paragraphs below, hope you like it and think

''which opinion is better in this essay?''.

The first reason the Face is a natural landform is because 25 years ago something happened on Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship ''Viking 2'', but when the camera spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, then they saw an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a fregion of the Red Planet called '' Cydonia''.

Another reason that the Face is a natural landform is because after a few days , NASA unveiled the image which had shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose and the mouth. But since it became so popular, the picture has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, etc. They also said that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact.

The last reason is that thousands of anxious people were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. But not everyone believed that.

The camera on board MGS had to peer thrrough wispy clouds to see the face, they say perhaps alien markings were hidden by a haze. People are also saying, ''We just dont pass over the face very often''.

But not everyone can be right because some people think its not a natural landform because it could be just a haze from something that was there at that specific moment and time to show that the face was there when it could have really been just a rock and not the Face after all. More reasons to this is that,even though it looked like a face...it couldnt have been, people couldve just seen the face that wasnt really there.

In Conclusion, people have different opinions on what they see and what they dont see in certain pictures. Some people see the face, some people dont see the face at all and that can be a good thing and a bad thing for some people who have different things to say about a certain subject. The Face couldve just been a rock in some peoples opinions, but some people think that it wasnt just a rock, it was an outline of a face.",0,444,3,7.780579820627803,15,182.55865419700658
10,"""Just be fair"" quotes many people everyday. In the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" I think that the Electoral College should be abolished and to elect a president by popular vote.

The first thing to remember, is that the Electoral College is unfair and needs to be changed to the popular vote because the people should be able to vote who they want to be president. The author mentions in Source: 3 paragraph 18 that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" This proves that with the Electoral College in place that there may be a big controversy about who should be the next president. Arguments would also break out between the political parties that are trying to elect their candidate president. With popular vote you could avoid all these conflicts and disputes by letting the people elect the president outright with no questions. With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as rodney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his polarity in states that he knows he will win."" A presidential candidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the candidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote.

Another key point, is that the number of votes coming from each state should be equal in the amount of votes. The author claims in Source 2: paragraph 10 that ""If you lived in Texas for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 electors pledged to Kerry. With popular vote you would not have to worry about all of the votes that each state gives from the Electoral College. Popular vote lets the people deside no the Electoral College deside. If two candidates were running for president and one was from Florida and the other one was from Alaska, their state could be the deciding factor which the one from Florida will win because it has more votes than Alaska which is not fair. Truly, the Electoral College should be replaced by popular vote because there is a winnertakeall system. The author shadows in Source 1: paragraph 7 that ""Most states have a ""winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation."" The thing is that with a popular vote system you would not have to worry about a winnertakeall and states that have a different system than the other states. Just let the people decide and everything will be easy and fair.

On the flip side, the Electoral College should not be replaced because it avoids any type of runoff election that may occur. The author argues in Source 3: paragraph 22 that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" This shows that with the Electoral College it would relieve all of the stress that is put on a candidate when they are running and the stress could also complicate the process of electing the president. With the Electoral College their will be a winner no matter what happens which will clearly the most fair way to complete the process of electing the president.

To conclude, after analyzingthe article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral Collge: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A.

11,"There is an oppurtunity of a lifetime just waiting for you. You would get to enjoy fun, games, travel, and you'd get to help people. You could change someone's life. You could become a hero! This oppurtuntiy is to become one of the UNRRA's Seagoing Cowboys. Seagoing Cowboys travel all over the world to to recover countries that were left in ruins from wars. You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.

It might just change your life, like it changed mine.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!

You get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.

You get an amazing expereince along the way. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see Europe and China, tour a castle in Crete, see the Acropolis in Greece, and even get a view at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have been able to have any of these experiences if it weren't for being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that you know all about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the benefits of being part of it, go sign up! You could be a person's hero. Mend the hearts of those who feel like they have nothing left. Feed those who hunger with no way to recieve food. Take the oppurtunity of a lifetime, and, maybe, it will change your whole life, like it changed mine.",0,406,19,6.58070591133005,11,212.62600542223942
12,"The main way the majority of the people in our community get around each and every day, is by car. A car is the number way that people get from point A to B, but this is not the case throughout the world. A lot of countries have taken to effect the amount of damage a car can do, so they are beginning to limit car usage. They are beginning to realize that there are benefits from not having to crank up a car every time they have to go to the store thats a minute or two up the road, or every time they have to go to school, or what ever the case may be. A lot of them are coming to the conclusion that by limiting the car usage will, lower the amount of pollution and smog that is released in the air, lower the stress on having to worry about gas prices, and citizens will be more motivated to work and etc.

The amount of pollution that is let out into the air every day is ridiculous. In a lot of countries, smog has become a big issue even with out the effects of car usage. Car usage only makes it worst. In France, there was recorded to be a numerous amount of cases where they reported a lot of congestion in the air, due to tha gas that was let out in the air due to the usage of the car. Paris began to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it was recorded that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, with Brussels having only 144 and London having 79.7. They began to momentarily stop miter vehicles dropping the amount on congestion to 60 percent.

Although the amount of excersie that is received is at an all time low. By banning the amount of car usage this pushes more people to get excersie. A lot of the people in our community always depend of the vehicle on four wheels to get us around, not realizing they have to feet. Most stores in our community are beginning to be built at every corner to make things a little bit more convenient and in walking distance, and by lowering the car usage a lot of us will have to begin to depend on walking, to get from point A to B. Which will, and can do a lot of our health in the long run.

Now many of us pass by more the one gas station a day, and begin to dread the prices of gas. The gas prices go up, and seem to consistitently go up more and more. A lot of those who work, don't like the fact that they have to give machines their money to get from place to place, and this only gets worst. Most children around teen ages who are beginning to get their liscense are not in the rush just for this exact reason. The prices of gas will only pull you down along with a lot of other expenses that people have to face everyday. Researchers have shown that the precentages in young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, many are beginning to realize the cons of how much driving can do. For example, the fact that it causes pollution, has a big effect on expenses and has a lot to do with excersing and etc. Many should to take these things into consideration before they try to argue it, and realize the positive effects it may have.",0,611,7,7.257173649754501,9,333.4379835724912
13,"Cars Driving On Their Own?

I am against Driverless Cars. This is because you can't trust the computers in the cars to not make mistakes. If the car makes a mistake and the passengers get hurt, there is no one to blame. What if the car causes a wreck and kills someone? How will their family have closure? They won't. It's not like you can put a car in jail like you can a reckless driver. These are some things to think about.

People would use this car as an excuse to go out dinking more. This would cause an increase in alcholism, leading to more deaths from liver failure. It would make it easier for people to conduct drive by shooting and get away with it. Even if they got caught weeks later, they would have had the time to make it seem like they weren't near the area because computers can be minipulated. Crimes would extremly high and there would be no one to take the blame.

Another question is, who would be responsible? Would it be the maker of the car or the ""driver?"" How many people would get tickets, because the police can't be sure that it wasn't the car that was swirving in between the lines? What if there is a bad signal and the cars stop in the middle of the highway? You can't trust a car that drives itsel, it's just not safe.

These cars would make it easier for rapists to track their targets. The cars would be putting lives in danger because people could track where they were at. Serial killers would be able to find people and not be thought of as a suspect because they wouldn't have to go near the person to find them. Is that really what seems best for the world?

It would mean people spending more money to buy and fix these cars. The minimum wage would go up causing the prices of other things to go up. The economy would hit a low and we wouldn't have the money to cover it. It is a ignorant idea to hav cars that drive all on their own. Think about that next time you think it's a good idea. Think about the peoples lives that would be put in danger.",0,384,2,6.073726115876072,11,194.50020714259512

The Seagoing Cowboys are helpfull for countries in need. Luke and Ron helped out countries that were destroyed by World War Two. They did that by dilivering animals to the destroyed places. If they didn't do that a lot of people might have died. Thats why peaple should join.

They could have a chance to become heros and save lives in countries in need. Also peole can have the advantage to see cool sights. Luke and Ron went to Acropolises in Greece, and went to a castle in Crete.

They also looked at the Panama Canal on their way to China. Becoming a Sea Cowboy gives you the chance to go around the world. Being a Sea Cowbay isn't a dangarous job either. Luke only endered one injury on the job from what the story said.

There's also a chance to have fun on board. When Luke went on return trips all the animals were unloaded. The crew was able to play games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than going on an adventure. It opens up the world for people who have never been to a lot of places. Luke was very gratefull for the opportunity to be a Sea Cowboy. It makes people more aware of the things that need to be stopped in the world. The awarness stays with you to. Luke went on to host a lot of international students and exchange visitors for the next coming years.

After the last paragraphs it makes it pretty obvious to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It makes a lot of good becoming one also. There is also new experiences to be made to. So if there's nothing working out for you maybe becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will fit yourself and give you a chance.",0,346,0,6.190620350807255,13,140.16034773402598
15,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", I learned thet computers can now feel what emotions that you are feeling. This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.

I think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.

But there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.

So in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test. But in all I do believe that if these were to come into our schools I would just hope one thing, and that is to be graduated befor that time comes.",0,307,10,7.63592559576346,7,212.64754781524462
16,"What do I think about driverless cars? I am for them and I am also against them at the same time. I do think that driverless cars are good for people who do not know how to drive very good, and for people who do not want to drive. I don't want them because I like to drive, and I like cars.

I think driverless cars would be good for people who are bad drivers, because then those people would not be causing trouble on the road. Also people that are scared driving would be better for them so they wouldn't be nervous and could relax in the car.

The reason I do not want driverless cars though is that I want to drive, I don't want a computer to do it for me. I love cars to and its fun driving them, what would be the point of that dream sports car you always wanted if a computer was going to drive it for you. Also, computers are pretty smart but they dont know everything for instance, if a deer runs infont of you on a backroad would the car know that usually more deer come after that, or would it slam into the second deer, would it know the roads like you do.

So I am for them and against them. I think I would be better if they were optional so if you didn't want to drive you could buy one but if not you can still buy a normal car.",0,254,16,6.767808377896613,7,181.6735129459505

I think that with out cars we would be fine. we just have to get use to it like we do with most things in life. Cars have helped us with time and comfterbility but i feel like is also hurting us,because we are getting use to a bad habit because we always want to use our cars when ever we go anywhere. I people in the united states are starting to realize that because in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. that means that some people are starting to stop using theyre cars because we are witnessing a long term cultural shif. With out cars i feel like pollution wouldnt effect us as it is right now, the cars is whats causing pollution because of the gas. most kids are starting to not care about cars. the reason for that is because they have found it easier to communicate because now we have all this smart phones and we dont have to be going to our friends house becayse we have facetime and things like that on our phones. now a car is just a means of getting from A to B when baert doesnt work.

Life on another planet sounds crazy but Venus once, many years ago had earth like features that could maybe prove that Venus is actually worth studing. The real question is, can research be done on another planet with such high temperatures? I believe the risk isn't worth the struggle but finding put more about Venus could bring many benefits. Author claims yes it could be done with the right equipment but is it worth the risk.

Could people live on another planet with such high temperatures? Well the author claims in the article, "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (The Challenge 4). This shows that life possibly existed in Venus many years ago and could maybe in the future carry human life. ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (The Challenge 3). With the right equipment, living on Venus could happen in the long future, but would people really what to live as robots in outter space avoiding the risks.

Life on a different planet could bring benefits in the long future. The author brought up many good reasons on why his idea of studing Venus is worthy of trying despite the dangers.

20,"The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way on deciding who's president. The electorsal college seem's to have many flaw's that can make voting a disaster. Voter's aren't truely voting for a president, they vote for a slate of candidates who then vote for president.

The worst part about this type of voting is the disaster factor sourse 2:paragraph 11. It clearly says "" segragationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeede in replacing the democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This shows that the results of an electorsal college can sometimes not be decided by the people, but mostly on the electorss of each state. People say the the electorsal college is an easier,cleaner, and faster method, but when it comes for the people to vote for president The electorsal college system wont suit what the people mainly would like.

The electorsal college is an unfair way to vote for president, During the 2000 caspian program, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.sourse 2: paragraph 13. These things shows that the candidates dont care about having the smaller states votes, but wants bigger populated states like california and texas. This is often called a "" Winnertakeall"" system since it each state doesn't get to see what there electors is really all about. Also it can show that with the electorsal college, electorss can vote for a president who is regionally favorable and not nationaly. This can often make the voters feel less satisfied with thier president since there president might not show interest in there opinions.

The Electoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which there is little to no popular votes what so ever. Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College sourse 3: paragraph 22.This goes to show that the Peoples votes dont usually matter when it comes to voting for a president but the electorss do.

But if while going to those places you relized you where just killing the earth every mile at a time. Cars give off gas that pollutes the air and harms us, and  begins to create green house gases. Over time these gases could do very harmful things to us. The soulution isnt as simple as everyone in the world giving up there car, But what if there is a long term soultion to fix this big problem.

In Vauban, Germany residents of this

Upper class community have given up cars in a experimental test to see the results of giving up cars to see others ways people could do about getting place to place and helping stop green house gases along the way. The results of doing this could mean that other countries, towns and cities may want to try this as well. In the town people make there way around by transportation such as bikes, running and walking. With this in mine you may be thinking what is I want to go the mall and its down a highway? Easy if the plan did happen things like malls, stores, food markets would be down the street so you can still enjoy the things you love but not have  to spend money on gas and car payments anymore.

Paris bans driving due to smog, After 2 days of record breaking pollution paris put into effect a new rule that would clear up there city. On a Monday all cars where to not be on roads and stayed parked. With the option to leave your car at home or pay a fine of 22 euro's, 4000 drivers were fined and 27 got there car towed away. With smog polluting the air tempertures and weather changes begin to happen with cold night and warm days car emissons where  trapped by warmer air. The act was a success and most pollution in the city was gone so by tuesday everyone could return back to driving.

In Bogota, Columbia Only buses and traxis where permitted fir the Day with a population of 7 million, the whole thing was a huge success and there was a huge turnout. The purpose of this was athe goal to promote alternative transpotation and reduce smog. Millions of colombians biked, skated hiked and took buses during the car free day leaving traffic jams and easing stress to many people. Authorties came to Bogota to see the event and not only where they enthusiastic but with them liking how the even happened it means they could do it for there city making a chain recation to more and more till all people would like to participate in this oppurtunity to help save the earth. This event was not a tragicic loss of not being able to drive it was just showing that there are other means of transportation and not driving your car can help you in many ways.

So with these efforts of showing it dosent hurt to try something and it can be a train reaction to starting something big to end green houses gases that people all over give to the earth on a daily baisis. This just shows that cities like ours could try things like this and maybe help start something that can have sucha huge impact on our lives. With this maybe peopl ewill start to relize tha tcars arent all a big thing, and maybe the peak could come to a end and people could start somehting new.

22,"The Electoral College. The electoral college is ,to the office of federal register, ""Is a process, not a place"", which, in reality, it is. The electoral college is something that the founding fathers established for a choice of voting. You can either vote your election in congress or by a vote of the citizens. In my opinion, I don't really think that this is a good idea. No one really knows who's voting for who. And most of the time, voters don't always control who they get to vote for. But this can be a good thing sometimes because it helps keep everything in order.

First of all, the electoral college is a bad thing because nobody really knows who's voting for who. Most of the time, soem voters get confused about the whole thing and end up voting for the wrong person. During the election, most people get, as I said before, confused. These people get confused because there's too much going on. theres one side voting for one person, the other side voting for the other, then out of nowhere here comes like, 3 more people that are racing, and no one even knew whos these people were because everyone is too caught up with the states votes being all over the place to focus on anything else.

Secondly, I really think that the electoral college is not that good of an idea because most people that are voting don't even get a choice on who they want to vote for. The legislative branch is technically suppossed to choose the electors of the state. The electors are the people who allow peoples votes to go through. They pretty much just sit there and say if your vote counts. And sometimes it doesn't count. If it doesn't, they just give you to the other candidate. So you really don't have a choice to as to which candidate you vote for or not.

The author supports the idea of studying Venus because the author says that Venus could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system and the curiosity researchers have to Venus, but thinking about the dangers and doubts that can occur. In paragraph 4 it says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""

The author talks about how NASA has a idea for sending humans to go study Venus and has a possible solution to do that, but it will be risky. In paragraph 5 it says, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vernusian landscape. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.""

Another reason, the author talks about how NASA and researchers are working on other ways to study Venus, doing innovations to contribute the knowledge of Venus, and doing comparsions on how it will affect them or improve on while thinking of studying Venus. In paragraph 7 it says,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

In conclusion, the author explains some of the ways researchers think about when wanting to explore Venus. They also think about the consequences, but really thinking on how to overcome them. This is a challenge and also a valuable way to gain curiosity and information about Venus.

Despite all the dangers Venus is still very much like Earth, and even though Venus would be very challenging to travel to it is still very much possible.

Venus was most likely the planet to be very much like Earth a very long time ago, but even today Venus has some features that are the same as Earth's. For example, in paragraph 4, the text states,""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment an includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus may not completely be like Earth, but it has vey similar features. Scientist already know about some of these features, but there are probably a lot more similarities between the two planets.

Traveling to Venus would be very challenging and even possibly life risking, but scientists are sure there is a way. NASA's idea is to hover over the fray with a blimp like vehicle, but there are still risks. In paragraph 5, the author says,"" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.""

Traveling to Venus would be an amazing thing for the people in NASA. There are many different risks, but so much would come ouf of traveling there. Having risks should not stop scientist from being able to experiment with different planets, especially one so close to home.

As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

JIm Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program had said that it ""eminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" Secondly, I believe that it is a landform because NASA has photographed this photo more than once to determine if it was an alien atrifact and after their second trip to Cydonia, they had enough information to say it is a martian landform. So in 1998, they had waited nearly eighteen years since the first photos of the face. The research crew took a new photo of the face that is ten times sharper than the 1976 photo. When it was released to the public, it had turned out to be a natural landform, not an alien monument. Lastly, I believe it is a nautral landform because in the 2001 photo of the landform, the Mars Global Surveyor took a new photo of the face using the camera's maximum resolution ""Each pixel spanned 1.56 meters, while the 1976 photo had spanned 43 meters. So, this abolishes the possibility of it being an alien artifact because if there were any egyptian style pyramids you would have been able to see them"" These are the facts that I believe determine that the face on mars is just a landform and not an alien artifact.",0,308,6,9.901797902097902,1,0.0
28,"Many people feel that the president plays a very imperative role in the United States. He has much responsibility and an enormous influence on what this country stands for. So, surely, this president must be carefully sought out from the abundance of other candidates. It is quite controversial as to what method is best for selecting them. Although an electoral college may appear as the right path, the countries interest invariably lies with the popular vote because it is fair and unstressful unlike the electoral college.

Firstly, the electoral college is quite unfair. It is mentioned by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" that some of the states do not even get to see candidates under the electoral college system. Candidates don't even bother with the states that they don't have a chance of winning over. They focus all of their attention on swings states. This means that some states have to vote based on just what they have heard. These people could have heard rumors and now are voting under false impressions. They deserve their own fair share of information from the candidates themselves. Also, under the electoral college the people of this nation aren't even voting for their president. They are voting for the electors. All that they can do is hope that the person that they voted for votes in their favor Plumer. There is no guarantee that they will, so people have little say in who is president. This is their country, they should be able to decide who does and doesn't govern it. It is mentioned that with the popular vote larger states get more attention than little ones Posner. The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college. Even Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO agree that the electoral college should be abolished.

As if this wasn't enough to get rid of the electoral system, the popular vote is also much less stressful. First off, the there could be a tie. If there is a tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is likely that the result of their voting will not be at the will of the people Plumer. Isn't it just easier to have their load lightened and take the stress of thep possibility off thier back? Although the outcome of a tie is unlikely Posner it is still possible and causing unnecessary stress. Additionally, the electoral college results in the presence of the disaster factor Plumer. If a repeat of the 2000 fiasco the biggest election crisis in the past hundred years Plumer is what America is looking for then by all means choose to stick with the electoral college.

In summation, it is prominent that the most potent option for this naiton is to elect the president of the United States by popular vote. Even though the electoral college does have some pros, the ultimate candidate is the popular vote as it ensures fairness and a virtually stressless voting process.",0,525,0,8.003419571518588,7,487.3732592967643
29,"I do not believe in driverless cars. Driving is something we look forward to. Once we get our license and can drive all that hard work is paid off. If computers drive for us then what is the point of having to wait?

I believe that if we, humans, have computers do everyhting for us then what will there be for us to do? I happen to really enjoy driving. If computers drive for us then who knows if there will be a maufunction and it wrecks without warning. While the author did say that the car alerts the so called driver if there is any need for human help, how will it be able to tell if it is a cunstrustion site for sure. Or what is the road changes? I don't think driverless cars are a smart idea. For example; most states in the US have laws against it, for our saftey. We should know that we can't count on computers to work 100% of the time. How many times a day does your microwave stop working? Or how many times do you have to reset you wifi? If we can't count on machines to bake our food for us than how can we count on them when we are putting lives at risk?

I know that there are some precautuions thatg can be taken to avoid this, but it's not worth the risk. Computer modified cars are helpful, but there should always be a human driving. While, most car accidents are human errors just think about how many times the driverless car will wreck until we have a perfect one.

30,"Dear Senator,

This brief letter is to show you my perspective on changing from the Electoral College to changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. I believe that the Electoral College should be changed because it's outdated, is very unfair, and is very misguiding.

The Electoral College should be changed because of how outdated it is. The United States is just calling for an update. And a productive and benificial update. Just like the update of IOS 7 that the Apple company has recently made. The Electoral College is just not as productive as it used to be. This is because of issues such as population increase. Since there's more people the electoral votes are more prone to getting miscounted or may lead to other problems.

Not only is the Electoral College outdated, however, it's also causes way to many dillemas. Thankfully this only haopens every four years so we get a break from hearing about all the troubles the Electoral College has done. For instance, the Electoral college is so unfair to voters because voters aren't even able to vote for thier candidate they have their electors vote for them. Therefore, even though this happens on very rare occasions the electors have the power to vote for whoever they might choose. Which also causes stress on the voters, this is due to the unconfirmed assumption that they might not be voting for who they claim to be.

Aswell as the Electoral College being outdated, and unfair it's also irrational. Direct voting instead of using the outdated, unfair Electoral College voting would be a great update to the United States. Beniffiting the voters, electors, and the elected.",0,285,3,8.013853973168214,9,229.65744753845138
31,"I do think the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is valuable. This new technologly can identify the emotion of humans. I would expecially recommed this in a classroom. The new technologly would make it easier for teachers. The FACS could be a subsitute for a teacher.

Why I think this new technologly is good is because it can tell weather the students are happy, sad, mad, bored, or confused. With there being many students in the class, teacher isnt able to see and tell every students emotions. By adding the FACS to the classroom ,it would make it easier. For example the passage said ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen , a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technologly could modify the lesson ,like an effective human instructor.

In conclusion, this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This would be a real good improvment in the schools around the world. This new software has promising applications for a variety of industries. This why I argue for this claim.

34,"Truthfully i don't really think this kind of technology would actually work. A persons emotions are determined by that person only. A computer no matter how many upgrades it has could never fully understand a persons emotions or even how they feel for that matter. A person can have many facial exprecions. They can show many feelings from happiness to saddness,from frustration to anger. If you look hard enough you can tell how someone is feeling by looking at their face but you don't need a computer to do it for you. Yes some computers are advanced enough to be able to tell how a person is feeling but they can never actually know what emotion they have. Sometimes faciale expercions can be unpredictable but if you pay attention you will be able to tell how someone is truly feeling. It mostly takes more then technology to tell how a person is feeling. It takes a real person with real eye's to really see. If somehow the kind of technology that can be able to tell how a person is feeling through facial expresions was developed then that would be impressive.

35,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depiste the dangers in presents"" Anyone would love to explore more than just the Earth we live on. Who wouldn't want to know more than what we know already about our planet Earth! Venus is one of the most interesting planets we would want to find more of or know about especially because Venus is our friendly neighbor other than Mars. Venus can be a challenging planet to study, and a very dangerous planet but it can end up being worthy information.

The author uses very good details to describe why Venus is a interesting planet to study. The way the author started off with "" Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky..."" is a very good way to drawl people into the topic of why Venus can be a worthy pusuit despite the danges it presents. Venus is the one of the closest plants to Earth and people often refer it to Earth's ""twin' because of the density and size. Venus can be a really challenging planet to study, the way the author used a details about the atmosphere and surface in paragraph 3 sounds even more challenging then what i thought. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dixoide..."" the author even stated that something even more challening than the 97% of carbon is the clouds! it has ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" doesn't that sound interesing but terrifying? The author stated that humans have sent numerous of spacecraft to the land but none of them have survived more than just a few hours.(paragraph 2).That just adds another reason to why Venus is a worthy pursuit to study. I know more scientist are mostly focused on studying Mars more than any other planet but the author is putting the spotlight on Venus and it's full of mystery's. The author also states that the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90x greater than what we experience on Earth, ISN""T THAT INSANE !!! imangine living on Venus and discovering all these other things we didn't even know that it exists. Venus is also being described to once being just like earth long long time ago. Venus still has some features that can be found on earth such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters (paragraph 4) this should be most definitely be another reason for humans to study Venus the way they study Earth and Mars. Each planet always has something different within each other, but we can't really study planets futher away from earth like Pluto. Pluto isn't referred to being a planet but it is in our glaxay so it should be considered one, we can't really study those planets well like the Mars, but Vensus is another option to study.

The author used a very good reasoning for Venus to be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The Earth, The Moon, and Mars should not be the only planets scientists or NASA studying. Venus most likely has more interesting, mysterious places or objects than just the atmosphere and the surface. Venus sounds like one great and definitely a worthy planet to study.",0,551,11,8.980261032863849,5,817.04501711962
36,"Driverless cars are not only a great thing for common folk, it is also a revolutionary idea that is being put into action right now. Picture a world where routes are more accessable, anybody could use this product, and less accedients would happen because AI driven cars. Back then, we didn't have the knowledge or technology to even test these sorts of ideas. As time goes on, man has created and gained the needed knowledge and technology to improve on our daily lives and society. Driverless cars are one step into the future.

Since it would be more time and money consuming to build better roads, we can only resort on the car. The car can easily be modified, manufactured, and tested. You can't go on and magically change the bridges or the humans that drive can you? The only thing er can do is better our cars for everyday citizens. GPS can finds ways to guide the car from destination to destination. You won't have to deal with angry drivers or crazy trafic because the driverless cars will know where to go. They will also do it with ease. You and your family could get to said destination with ease and perfection. Taking the fastest and safest routes whilst the passengers and enjoying their time. No more trafic jams or late meetings. All thanks to driverless cars.

Driver licenses will become a short coming with these types of cars aswell. There would be no reason for testing to see if the driver can drive because the car will be doing the driving! The only thing you'd be doing is buying the car. Anyone, from elder to todler, will be able to get in the car and enjoy the view of the city as the driverless car is criusing about the streets. And as you are in those streets, you can possibly use other types of innovative ideas that have been implemented into the car. Voice commands, television, games,etc... They can all be placed inside the car to fit the needs of the buyer. All of this is possible because cars are so easy to modify.

When driving, you have so many negative things being pushed into your general area as you are driving. Civilians, clueless drivers, bikers, drunk drivers, and you, are in risk when driving. With the car being AI controlled, you won't have to deal with any of those hazards. If the car detects strange or threatening behavior in it's area, it'll simply take another route or avoid the danger. Driverless cars don't have to deal with emotion. They're not angry or scared. Driverless cars deal with the task that has been givin to them without hesitation.

Some will accept the future, few will become it. Driverless cars are nothing more than the surface of a brighter tomarrow. Better roads, easily accessibility, and fewer accidents are todays tomarrow. The more wider our ideas get, the better we become as people who inhabit this world. Driverless cars are one step into the future.

40,"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.",0,854,0,9.114525317185697,9,530.1455658473947
41,"Aliens vs. Knowledge

Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?

A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.

NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.

Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.

Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.

Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.

Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.

To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.

Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.

We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.

So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.",0,686,18,7.410327826086957,23,201.65422688645043

When I got to help people I also got to see that part of the country. I have made nine trips. More than any of other Seagoing Cowboy. You could probably go on more trips. We had to have 335 horses and food to take to Greece. Before that, we had to report to New Orleans.

When I turned 18 I could've been drafted to military but when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip they didn't make me. I was already helping other people out there. We helped people by recovering their food supplies, animals, and more. So you should benefit others and join us. It would help us and other people out there.

If you enter the Seagoing Cowboys you could sight all the countries in the world. You would also get to help others that have been hurt, and raise animals to give to others. This is a great way of helping other people with out anything. You would also get to explore other parts of the world. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",0,302,24,6.282675913662006,9,153.9928649942451
44,"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of ""If it aint broke dont fix it."" Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you.",0,417,14,7.825058848405986,9,249.86001018842137
45,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing you a letter in regards of the electoral college. I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. While it is a good system, it is not reliable and does not let the people truly decide who their representative will be. It does bring some certainty of outcome but not as much as it should.

The electoral college must be abolished because it does not let the people truly decide who their president will be. While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote, they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. A good example of that is in 2000, when Al Gore ran against George W Bush. Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, "" When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference, it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate.

Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have. In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.

So because the electoral college is obviously unfair, it should be abolished. Because the voters are told they decide who reopresents them, yet they do not. There is a possibility, while slim that a president could win the popular votes, yet lose the election because of the way the electoral college is set up. So because it unfair to the presidential candidates, it should be abolished and we should have elections controlled by popular votes.",0,580,7,8.013578350515463,9,474.7809111371759
46,"Cars have dramatically changed the way human kind lives and they have not been ran by computers, only us. Humans have always been the one in control of cars. People can operate a car perfectly fine without assistance, so why are there people trying to make cars that drive themselves? A number of things could go wrong with a computer car. Technology always tends to crash or shut down unexpectedley, so what happens if our computer car does that in the middle of traffic?

To start off, the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" seems biased. There are many paragraphs backing up the new Google Cars, and only a couple backing up how dangerous they can be. What is hard for me to understand is the whole point of the self driving cars. Why do we need them? Do certain people have better things to do in a vehicle than drive it themselves? If someone were to buy one of these cars, i would assume that they would be in a constant fear that maybe the car would take a wrong turn and run into a tree.

Cars that we drive today can already malfunction in many ways. The breaks could go out, the tranmission could go out, the headlights could go out, the tires could fall off, etc. We can fix the tires falling off, we can fix our headlights, but does everybody know how to fix a computer when it crashes? We could be on the road eating food while our car drives itself and the car just completely stop because the computer in the car crahsed. Instead of paying 60 dollars for a tire repair, getting the Google car repaired would probably cost a few hundred that nobody would want to pay.

Google cars could cause a stir between the manufacturers and the drivers as well. If a driver was positive that the crash they had was the computer cars fault, that would cause problems. The car manufacturers would definately not want to admit they are at fault. The car would of course be very expensive, too. Many people will not even be able to afford a car that drives itself, but why would they want to? A self driven car can take away the fun in operating something big.

Why do we want to take the fun out of driving and feeling in control, or pay a big price for our computer car malfunctioning? Why do we want to put ourselves in even more danger by making an untrustworthy computer in charge of our lives? A computer car puts our lives at stake, and if a computer car proved to be at fault of a murder, that would also put the car creators in a bad situation.",0,460,16,6.887086382978723,9,247.72824617030912

Just think about it by limiting the usage of cars you are saving money and making the earth a cleaner place. It's like the old saying goes ""kill two birds with one stone.

Who doesn like having some extra money in there pockets to spend? I know I definetely do. By limiting the usage of cars people will no longer have to pay a car payment. Or even better have to pay these outrageous gas prices. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have at law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" If we limit the usage of cars there wont be any reason to build new highways and the money can go to more important things.

Wouldnt you like to wake up in the morning, walk out side and get a wiff of fresh clean air? Limiting car usage will also cut the amount of green house gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emotions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states."" Cars are major contribution to the pollution we have in the air today. Having cleaner air makes the earth an all around better place. The people will be happier and the grass will be greener. ""Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london."" I dont know of any person on this earth that wants to breath in particulate matter on a daily basis. ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man Carlos Arturo. This man is in his right mind. Polution is a major stressor for everyone. Thats why I say by limiting car usage it will make people happier. People act like riding a bike is a bad thing. Its always good to get some exercise and be healthy.

And if we dont have highways then city will be smaller.""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" Where i grew up everything was close. There were resturants less than a mile away. The mall was a 5minute bike ride. And school was only 10 minutes away. Everythig was convienent. I didnt have to get in the car and hope that it started it up. There was no waiting in traffic. All I had to do was hop on my bike and ride off.

If we stay at the rate we are going now the earth is going to turn in to a place that no one wants to live. So if we limit the usage of cars the earth will be a overall better place to live. If we dont drive there is less polution. If we dont have cars we dont need highways and the our city will be more compact. And no cars means more money in our pockets.

50,"Limiting car usage can provide many advantages for both individuals and the environment. The passage set highlights several instances where car-free or car-reduced communities have been implemented and the positive outcomes that have resulted from these changes. One example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. As a result, the community has a higher quality of life, with less pollution, noise, and stress. Additionally, there has been a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, a major contributor to climate change.

Another example is the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people chose to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. This event promotes alternative transportation methods and aims to reduce smog. Despite occasional rain showers, the turnout for the car-free day was large, showing that people are enthusiastic about the opportunity to lower air pollution and reduce stress.

The decrease in car usage in the United States is also highlighted in the passages. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, so reducing car usage can help combat climate change. Additionally, the decrease in driving can lead to less traffic congestion, resulting in shorter commute times and improved air quality for everyone.

There are multiple factors contributing to this change in behavior. The advancement of technology, such as the internet and smartphones, has made telecommuting and flexible commuting arrangements more feasible. The rise of shared transportation services, like bike-sharing and car-sharing programs, has also provided people with more options for getting around. Furthermore, the revitalization of urban centers has made suburbs less appealing, encouraging people to live in more walkable communities where they have easy access to amenities and public transportation.

Despite these positive outcomes, some concerns exist about the future of car culture and the impact of changing driving habits on the car industry. However, there is a growing recognition that personal vehicle ownership may not be practical or desirable in the long run. In response, some car companies are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies and envision a future where different modes of transportation are seamlessly connected to save time, resources, and improve safety.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate how car-free or car-reduced communities can lead to a higher quality of life, reduced pollution, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This shift in behavior is supported by advancements in technology and a growing desire for more sustainable and accessible modes of transportation. While there may be concerns about the future of the car industry, it is clear that reducing car usage can bring about positive changes for everyone.",1,481,0,10.617246583850932,11,271.1889951203407
51,"Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and should be replaced with a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several important advantages that should be considered. 

The first advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system where disputes over the outcome are more likely, the winner of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This allows for a more streamlined and stable process, ensuring a clear winner in each election cycle.

A second advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, making it necessary for candidates to have broad appeal across different regions. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the President represents the interests of the entire nation.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign heavily in swing states. This prompts them to communicate their policies and listen to the concerns of voters in these key states. Consequently, swing state voters, who are more likely to be well-informed and thoughtful, have a greater impact on determining the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores political balance to the weight of large states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the issues of densely populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that candidates devote attention to smaller states as well. This prevents large states from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates address the concerns of voters in both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential delays associated with runoff elections, providing a more efficient and decisive election process.

Some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter participation, particularly for individuals in states heavily favoring one political party. However, voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, suggesting that voters are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that their vote will single-handedly decide the outcome of the election.

In conclusion, while there are criticisms of the Electoral College, I believe the advantages it provides in terms of certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance for large states, and avoidance of runoff elections make it a valuable system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures fair representation of the entire nation and promotes a stable and decisive electoral process. Therefore, I request that you consider these factors when deciding the future of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your continued efforts to promote the best interests of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

52,"As a grade 10 student, I believe that limiting car usage is essential for the well-being of our community and the environment. The passage set provides valuable information and ideas that support this notion.

Firstly, reducing car usage can significantly decrease air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is a major environmental risk to health, causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths each year. The passage from the Union of Concerned Scientists states that transportation is responsible for 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with cars being the largest contributor. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere, improving air quality and public health.

Secondly, limiting car usage can also help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute states that traffic congestion costs the US economy $124 billion annually in wasted time and fuel. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion, saving time and money for commuters. Additionally, the passage from the American Public Transportation Association highlights the benefits of public transportation, including reduced traffic congestion, lower emissions, and increased mobility for those who cannot drive.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and health. The passage from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, we can encourage physical activity and improve public health.

Lastly, limiting car usage can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The passage from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that the transportation sector is responsible for 13.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By transitioning to cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is essential for improving air quality, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting physical activity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The passage set provides compelling evidence for the benefits of reducing car usage, and as a grade 10 student, I believe it is our responsibility to take action and promote sustainable transportation options for a healthier, more sustainable future.

53,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to share my perspective on whether the United States should keep the current Electoral College system or change to a popular vote for electing the president. After reviewing arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe the Electoral College system should be maintained.

While a popular vote seems straightforward and democratic, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on population centers. If presidential elections were decided by national popular vote, candidates may concentrate campaign visits and promises only in states with very large populations. This could neglect the interests of smaller states and rural regions. The current system encourages candidates to consider a wider range of issues that are priorities for different parts of the country. 

It is also important to acknowledge that the United States was designed as a representative democracy, not a pure democracy, with the federal government representing the interests of both large and small states. Removing the Electoral College could shift more power to solely population-based interests. While some argue this aligns with the democratic principle of one person, one vote, changing the system could upset the intended balance of state and federal power. 

Additionally, election outcomes could see some states effectively ignored under a national popular vote system. It is possible a candidate could win the national popular vote while losing in almost every individual state. This may not align with many citizens' expectations of how the president should be elected. The Electoral College encourages candidates to build support across many states rather than just a handful of largest population centers.

Of course, reasonable people can disagree on this issue. Some of the counterarguments in favor of a popular vote also have merit, such as aligning the results with the overall national preference. However, on balance the advantages of maintaining the current Electoral College system outweigh the benefits of changing to a national popular vote system, in my view. I hope you will consider these perspectives as this issue is debated. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

54,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place. While there are valid arguments against it, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" I find the points made by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" to be more convincing.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the outcome can still occur, they are less likely than in a direct popular vote system. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral vote victory for even a slight plurality in a state. This helps provide a clearer and more decisive outcome.

Another important factor in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. As Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters across different regions. This is crucial for a successful president, as it helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also ensures that residents from all regions feel represented and that their interests are taken into account.

The focus on swing states is another positive aspect of the Electoral College. Posner argues that the winner-take-all system incentivizes candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on the states that are more evenly divided, known as swing states. These states receive more attention from candidates, which leads to a more engaged and informed electorate in these crucial states. This allows for a more thoughtful decision-making process and ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election.

The Electoral College also helps balance the influence of large and small states. As Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives more weight to small states in terms of representation. The Electoral College helps to restore some balance by providing larger states with more electoral votes. This means that presidential candidates must consider the interests and concerns of voters in both large and small states, preventing the majority from completely overshadowing the minority.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This is another advantage highlighted by Posner. In such cases, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner, reducing the need for additional elections and potential complications in the presidential election process.

In conclusion, while the arguments against the Electoral College presented by Bradford Plumer are valid, I believe that the advantages described by Judge Richard A. Posner outweigh the shortcomings. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters, ensures the representation of different regions, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for keeping the Electoral College in place.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from multiple sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the method for selecting the President.

Firstly, one of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of the Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, even with a slight plurality. This ensures a clear and decisive outcome for the presidency.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of everyone's President. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the presidency. This is important because it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and avoids a situation where certain regions feel disenfranchised.

Thirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Plumer highlights in his article that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to appeal to voters in toss-up states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions, thereby ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters play a significant role in deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College restores some of the political balance lost by large states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This means that presidential candidates are more likely to pay attention to large states during their campaigns, as the number of electoral votes a large state offers is significant. This ensures that issues and concerns of states with larger populations are not overshadowed by smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections that can prolong the election process and further divide the nation.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who feel their votes will have no effect, the fact remains that the Electoral College method continues to encourage voter participation. As Plumer mentions, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preference rather than expecting their single vote to decide the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for electing the President of the United States. The certainty of outcome, the representation of all regions, the focus on swing states, the balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections are all valid reasons to support the Electoral College system. While some argue for direct popular vote, the Electoral College effectively achieves the goals of fairness, representation, and avoiding potential election crises.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our democracy.

56,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for society and the environment. This can be seen in various cities and countries where efforts have been made to reduce reliance on automobiles, such as in Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia. These examples demonstrate that smart planning and alternative transportation options can create numerous benefits for communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Automobiles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, specifically in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, significant reductions in emissions can be achieved.

Another advantage is improved air quality. Smog and pollution caused by cars can have detrimental effects on public health. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to severe smog. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent, and the city saw improvements in air quality (Duffer). Car-free days in Bogota also demonstrated the positive impact on air pollution, with the streets being noticeably devoid of traffic jams (Selsky). Limiting car usage promotes alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, which contribute to cleaner air.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have social and economic advantages. By reducing car ownership, individuals can experience a decrease in stress and an increase in happiness, as seen in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Rosenthal). This shift can create a safer and more pleasant living environment, free from noise and pollution. Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the revitalization of center cities, making them more appealing and drawing people back in (Rosenthal). This can stimulate economic growth, with the development of new businesses and improved infrastructure.

Critics may argue that limiting car usage restricts personal freedom and convenience. However, the rise of technology and alternative transportation options, such as bike-sharing programs and car-sharing services, have provided viable alternatives that offer convenience and flexibility. Additionally, the demographic shift observed in younger generations, where driving and car ownership are becoming less important, suggests that there may be a cultural change in progress (Rosenthal). This shift towards shared transportation and alternative modes aligns with the goals of reducing emissions and creating more sustainable communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and positive social and economic impacts make a compelling case for implementing measures to promote alternative transportation options. As demonstrated by examples in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, creating car-free or low-car communities can result in a happier, healthier, and more sustainable future.",1,476,0,11.348026857142857,13,272.7649138449666
57,"The Face on Mars: A Natural Landform 

For decades, the unusual pattern seen on the surface of Mars known as the ""Face on Mars"" has fueled speculation that it was sculpted by ancient aliens. However, scientific evidence tells a different story and shows that this landform is a result of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. 

The main claim that the Face is a natural landform is based on analyses of higher resolution images taken by NASA's Viking orbiter in the late 1970s. These images revealed that the alleged ""Face"" is simply a pattern of light and dark patches formed by differences in rock composition and erosion. There are groups of mesas and hills in the area that are bisected by valley networks, creating the overall facial appearance from certain angles. However, up close it is clear that there are no definitive facial features like eyes or a mouth, just irregular rocky outcrops.

Additional evidence comes from experiments done by NASA scientists to simulate the effects of natural weathering over long periods of time. When they exposed landscape models resembling the Cydonia region to conditions similar to Mars, patterns reminiscent of the ""Face"" began to emerge after hundreds or thousands of simulated years. The wind erosion gradually hollowed out darker rock and left lighter colored, harder rock behind - naturally forming strange patterns that resemble recognizable shapes from a distance, like faces or animals. 

In conclusion, while initial low-resolution images of the ""Face on Mars"" led some to imagine it was sculpted intentionally, higher quality evidence shows that it is clearly a natural rock formation shaped by normal geological processes like erosion. Claims of an artificial construct require extraordinary evidence, which has not been found. The ""Face"" is more reasonably explained as a trick of light and shadow perceived by our pattern-seeking minds rather than visitation by an ancient alien civilization. For these reasons, the scientific consensus is that Mars still retains no evidence of past or present life, artificial or otherwise.",1,333,1,10.897238731443995,9,266.1676349155607
58,"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. Firstly, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases into the environment which can have negative effects on our health. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in our cities and improve the air quality for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, there are too many cars on the road, which leads to traffic jams and long commuting times. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to use public transportation or to cycle or walk instead, which can help to reduce traffic and make commuting faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Cars are one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels, and as these resources become scarcer, we need to find alternative ways to fuel our transportation needs. By reducing car usage, we can encourage the development of alternative transportation options, such as electric cars or public transportation powered by renewable energy.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reducing air pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. As citizens, we have a responsibility to take action to address these issues and create more sustainable communities. This can start with small changes, such as using public transportation or cycling instead of driving, and can ultimately lead to significant improvements in our environment and quality of life.",1,256,11,9.547613461538461,7,203.56656635797418
59,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.

Body:

Paragraph 1:

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.

Paragraph 2:

Beyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.

Paragraph 3:

Additionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.

Paragraph 4:

The success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. It is essential for citizens and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards making our communities more sustainable and livable for future generations.",1,508,1,12.096532889158087,27,237.69216758129085
60,"This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.",1,235,0,8.39166827852998,1,0.0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the current electoral process for the election of the President of the United States. Specifically, I want to discuss the importance of keeping the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. After reading and analyzing several sources on the topic, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained due to its practical advantages and ability to ensure a fair and representative election.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined in the passage from the Office of the Federal Register, is the certainty of outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has broad support across various regions of the country (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This is crucial to maintaining a diverse and inclusive democracy, as it prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas while neglecting the interests and needs of less populous states and regions (Posner, 2016, p. 21).

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president"" by encouraging candidates to appeal to voters from different regions and not just concentrate on swing states (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This helps to prevent regional biases and ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just particular regions. It also avoids the potential for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process and may not necessarily result in a clear winner (Posner, 2016, p. 22).

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages campaigns to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is less predictable (Posner, 2016, p. 20). This promotes voter engagement and participation, as voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and listen to the competing candidates (Posner, 2016, p. 20). By giving greater attention to swing states, candidates can better understand and address the concerns of a wider range of voters, leading to a more representative outcome.

While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the notion that it may increase voter turnout, these arguments do not outweigh the advantages of the Electoral College system (Plumer, 2016, p. 13). In fact, the Electoral College ensures that elections can be decided with relative certainty and prevents scenarios where a slight plurality of votes can result in a contested outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). This helps to uphold the integrity of the election process and maintain public trust and confidence in the system.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical advantages of the Electoral College system, as outlined in the texts provided. By maintaining the Electoral College, we can ensure fair representation, prevent regional biases, and promote voter engagement across the nation. While improvements can be made to the system, I believe that completely abandoning the Electoral College would be a disservice to the principles of our democracy. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,506,8,11.691025625,19,242.55015188056538
62,"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can have far-reaching benefits for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can create more sustainable and livable communities, while also addressing the growing concern of greenhouse gas emissions.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in pollution. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant cause of climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

In addition to reducing pollution, limiting car usage can also help to create more accessible and walkable communities. As mentioned in the passage, the German suburb of Vauban has implemented a car-free policy, resulting in streets that are safe and welcoming for pedestrians and cyclists. This can lead to improved physical and mental health for residents, as they are encouraged to be more active and spend more time outdoors.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. As more people choose alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking, the number of cars on the road decreases. This can result in shorter commute times and less stress for individuals who no longer have to deal with the frustrations of traffic jams. As mentioned in the passage about Paris, a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The passage mentions that car ownership in the United States has been decreasing, with more people choosing not to own a car. This can lead to significant cost savings for individuals who no longer have to worry about car payments, insurance, and maintenance. Additionally, the development of car-reduced communities can create new opportunities for businesses and services, as stores are placed within walking distance of residential areas.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing pollution, creating more accessible communities, reducing traffic congestion, and providing economic benefits, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future. It is important for individuals and communities to consider these advantages and actively work towards reducing their reliance on cars for the benefit of both ourselves and the environment.",1,405,4,10.606011111111112,11,220.780583647436
63,"I am in support of the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars are a great invention that can help reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” driverless cars use sensors and computers to navigate the roads, which can reduce the number of accidents caused by human error.

Additionally, driverless cars can also help reduce traffic congestion. The article explains that driverless cars can communicate with each other, which can help them move more efficiently on the road. This can reduce the amount of time people spend stuck in traffic.

Furthermore, driverless cars can also help people who are unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled. The article mentions that driverless cars can provide a new level of independence for these individuals.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a positive step forward. They can help reduce accidents, traffic congestion, and provide independence for those who are unable to drive. While there may be some challenges to overcome, the benefits of driverless cars far outweigh the negatives.",1,178,1,9.44830303030303,7,141.16425517380634
64,"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for society. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where efforts to reduce car dependency have resulted in improved quality of life, reduced pollution, and increased accessibility to transportation.

In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have made the bold decision to give up their cars. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and stress-free environment for the community members. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains how giving up her car has made her much happier. This sentiment is shared by many others who enjoy the verdant streets free from the noise and pollution of cars.

The trend of reducing car usage is not limited to Germany. In Paris, a partial driving ban was recently enforced to combat smog and reduce pollution. The ban applied to motorists with even-numbered and odd-numbered license plates on different days. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent. The success of this temporary ban suggests that limiting car usage can be an effective means of improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion in cities.

Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has been implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. During this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. The event has been successful in reducing traffic jams and creating a cleaner and quieter city for one day. The high turnout and participation in this event indicate the willingness of people to embrace alternative modes of transportation when given the opportunity.

The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond personal well-being and environmental benefits. Reducing car dependence can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the case of Vauban, stores are located within walking distance on a main street, eliminating the need for large malls along distant highways. This not only promotes physical activity but also fosters a sense of community and social interaction. Additionally, the availability of public transportation becomes more crucial in car-reduced communities. Efforts are being made in the United States to increase the role of public transport in suburban areas, with the expectation that it will be given greater priority in future transportation bills.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the improved quality of life, reduced pollution, and increased accessibility to transportation that have been observed in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota. As urban planners and policymakers recognize the need for smart planning and alternative transportation options, the trend of reducing car dependency is expected to continue. This shift will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the wellbeing of the environment and the development of more sustainable communities.",1,471,0,10.840029817409768,11,267.7345422689552
65,"The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage

There are several benefits to limiting car usage and promoting more sustainable transportation options. Reducing automobile dependence can positively impact both the environment and public health.

One way cities can become greener is by having fewer vehicles on the road each day. According to Passage 1, motor vehicles account for nearly a quarter of carbon emissions in large cities. By choosing alternatives like biking, walking or public transit when possible, individuals can collectively lower their carbon footprint. Even modest decreases in driving through initiatives like work-from-home policies and ride-sharing can meaningfully curb emissions over time. As Passage 2 notes, transportation emissions are a leading cause of poor air quality and greenhouse gas accumulation worldwide. Limiting these pollution sources is critical to environmental protection.  

In addition to environmental advantages, reducing car usage also brings health perks. Passage 3 found that residents of communities designed around public transit and active travel reported higher levels of physical fitness. Walking or biking for short commutes helps adults and children stay active in their daily routines. Fewer vehicles on the road also means less noise and traffic, creating a more peaceful living and working environment. Reduced traffic congestion lessens stress levels. With less time spent driving, individuals gain free hours for other priorities. 

By promoting behavioral changes and transportation alternatives, cities can encourage sustainable lifestyles while improving citizen well-being. A mix of infrastructure investments, ride-sharing networks, work policies and public education can bring about this shift over the long run. While changes may occur gradually, the environmental and health returns of curbing automobile dependence make limiting car usage a worthwhile goal for communities.",1,274,0,10.659730914555604,9,260.3475360094135

68,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to urge you to reconsider our country's current use of the Electoral College system. After deep investigation and consideration, I have found that most voters, myself included, would instead prefer a direct election.

In our status quo, as established by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process comprises of elector selection, meetings, and vote counting by Congress. Each state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of its Congressional delegation members. However, this process has its flaws, as stated by Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" In his plight for a change to direct vote, he argues that the Electoral College system is both non-democratic and confusing, leading potentially to electoral ""disasters."" In fact, electors have historically flouted public opinion and voted according to their own whim, which undermines democratic principles.

Opponents of the direct vote system argue that the Electoral College offers ""certainty of outcome,"" encourages candidates to have a ""trans-regional appeal,"" and ensures that more ""thoughtful voters"" will decide elections, as Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out in his essay ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" While these are seemingly valuable benefits, they do not sufficiently counterbalance the principle of fairness that our democracy should uphold. More fundamentally, it does not sit well with a vast majority of people that someone can win the most popular votes and still lose the presidency. 

In addition, the Electoral College seems to exacerbate the gap between different states' political influence. As it stands, candidates tend to pay more attention to larger states and swing states, leaving lesser populous states feeling neglected, which contradicts the principle of equality that a democratic nation should cherish. Consequently, the system favors some voters over others, as Plumer explained. 

The arguments against the Electoral College system align more consistently with our democratic ideals than the arguments in favor of maintaining it. As the matters stand, the Electoral College system feels outdated and disjointed from the transformation our society has experienced since it was established. 

I appeal to you to advocate on our behalf to maintain our country's integrity by replacing this flawed system with a direct voting system, which would foster a more accurate representation of our citizenry in the election of our President.

Yours sincerely,
[Your name]",1,383,13,10.840347444065788,16,228.67169937215667
69,"Hey, I know you think the Face on Mars is like this super cool sign of alien life and all, but let me tell you, it's just not that exciting. I mean, sure, it looks kinda like a face, but that's just because our brains are wired to see patterns and stuff. It's like when you see a picture of a dog in the clouds - it's not actually a dog, it's just clouds. Same thing with the Face on Mars.

First of all, let's talk about how the Face was even discovered. It was like, way back in the 70s, when some dude named Viking Orbiter took a picture of Mars and people were like 'oh my gosh, it's a face!' But then, when they took a closer look, they realized it wasn't actually a face at all. It was just a bunch of mountains and valleys that happened to look like a face from really far away. I mean, come on, have you ever seen a mountain that looks like a face? It's not that rare, guys.

And then there's the whole thing about the Face being a sign of alien life. Like, hello, if there was really an alien civilization on Mars, don't you think we would have found way more evidence of it by now? I mean, we've been studying Mars for ages, and we've found like, a bunch of rocks and some ice. That's it. No aliens, no fancy buildings, no nothing. Just rocks and ice.

Plus, the Face is like, really small compared to the rest of Mars. It's like, a tiny little mountain range in the middle of this huge planet. If aliens really wanted to communicate with us, don't you think they would have built something a bit bigger? Something we could actually see from Earth, instead of having to send a spacecraft all the way to Mars to find it? It just doesn't make sense, guys.

So yeah, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not some super cool sign of alien life. It's just a natural landform that happens to look like a face from really far away. Let's not get our hopes up, okay? We'll find alien life someday, I'm sure, but it's not gonna be on Mars, and it's not gonna look like a face.

70,"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a scientifically worthy pursuit, despite the planet's hostile environment. While Venus presents extreme dangers like its crushing atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, the knowledge to be gained from exploring Earth's enigmatic neighbor outweighs these risks. 

Key evidence supports this view. Venus is Earth's planetary twin in size, yet its surface conditions could not be more different. As the author notes, understanding how Venus evolved so differently provides insight into Earth's past and future climate changes. Venus also holds clues about the initial state of our inner solar system before Mars, Earth and Venus diverged onto separate paths of development. Solving these scientific mysteries could help prevent or mitigate climate crises on Earth.

Furthermore, advances in materials science have enabled crafts like the proposed ""heat-resistant balloon"" to withstand Venus' deadly atmosphere. Robotics may allow future missions to ascend through the clouds where conditions resemble Earth. While technology has not conquered Venus' extreme hazards altogether, each discovery pushes the boundaries of what is scientifically possible. Where there is potential for new knowledge, continued study remains justified - even for the most forbidding environments in our solar system. 

In conclusion, the author presents a strong case that exploring Venus holds value that outweighs its dangers. Unraveling Venus' evolution could inform efforts to safeguard Earth's habitability. Technological progress also makes future missions safer. While extreme caution is warranted, closing our eyes to Venus' secrets would be a loss for science. The mysteries of our neighboring planet are still worth facing its formidable challenges to solve.",1,272,4,11.249942857142857,9,226.36341369958262
71,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage has gained momentum in recent years, with numerous benefits becoming apparent. One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 70% of families in the community do not own cars. This means that residents are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transit. These activities contribute to increased physical activity and better overall health. In fact, in Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day resulted in millions of people hiking, biking, and skating to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The passage about Paris discusses how a partial driving ban was enforced due to intense smog. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Vehicles, especially diesel ones, are a major source of air pollution, so reducing their usage can have a significant impact on the quality of air we breathe.

In addition to these environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient and sustainable urban planning. The passage mentions the concept of ""smart planning,"" which involves separating suburban life from auto use. This means creating communities where stores are located within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible. By doing so, we can reduce the need for large parking spaces, which take up valuable land, and encourage more people to use alternative modes of transportation.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 57% of families sold a car to move there. This suggests that owning a car is a significant financial burden for many individuals and families. By reducing car usage, people can save money on car ownership, fuel, insurance, and maintenance costs. Additionally, the passage mentions that delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris. However, exceptions were made for vehicles carrying three or more passengers, which encourages carpooling and helps reduce transportation costs for individuals.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthy lifestyles, improvement of air quality, more efficient urban planning, and economic benefits. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can create greener, healthier, and more sustainable communities.",1,467,4,10.627123931769724,13,255.9394575229848
72,"Dear Senator,

As an 8th grader learning about the American political system, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place for electing the President of the United States. Although some might argue in favor of a popular vote system, I firmly hold the opinion that the Electoral College is the best way to ensure a fair and democratic election.

Firstly, the Electoral College is a fair system as it gives every state a voice in the election. In the current system, states with a smaller population have equal representation with the states having a larger population. This system ensures that the smaller states have their say in the election as well, making it a fair process.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a safety net in case an unfit candidate is elected. It allows the electors to vote against their state’s popular vote if they feel that the majority vote is not in the best interest of the country. This provides an extra layer of protection against the possibility of an unfit candidate being elected.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system also encourages candidates to focus on issues that matter to the entire country, rather than just a few swing states. This ensures that the President is elected on their merit, rather than just their ability to appeal to certain parts of the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College has been in place since the founding of our nation and has served us well. Although it may not be perfect, it has stood the test of time and has allowed for a stable democratic process. Changing the system to a popular vote could cause instability and create a new set of issues.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is the best system for electing the President of the United States. It is a fair and democratic process that ensures that every state has a voice in the election. Additionally, it provides a safety net against unfit candidates being elected and encourages candidates to focus on issues that matter to the entire country. Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter.

73,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an article about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotions. The system can detect the smallest movements in the face to determine what emotion someone is feeling. While this is a fascinating technology, it raises the question of whether it's valuable to use it to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

On one hand, the Facial Action Coding System could be helpful for teachers to know if a student is struggling or not engaged in a lesson. For example, if a student is frowning or has a furrowed brow, the teacher might know to check in with them and offer help. This technology could also help teachers identify bullying or other negative behaviors in the classroom.

However, on the other hand, using this technology could invade a student's privacy. It may make students feel uncomfortable or like they're being watched all the time. Additionally, the technology may not always be accurate, and a student could be misjudged based on their facial expressions.

In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System is a fascinating technology, it may not be valuable to use in a classroom setting. While it could potentially help teachers identify struggling students, it could also make students uncomfortable and potentially misjudge them. It's important to consider the privacy and feelings of students before using technology like this in the classroom.",1,237,0,9.44725369595537,7,181.97521697153363
74,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to argue that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give smaller states more influence, I believe the popular vote would be a fairer representation of the will of the American people.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates today focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. With a national popular vote, candidates would have to appeal to a wider range of voters across rural, suburban and urban areas. It would encourage both major party candidates to promote policies favored by a diverse cross-section of Americans. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might only campaign in population centers. However, in recent elections we see candidates almost exclusively campaigning and spending money in only a handful of swing states. A national popular vote would motivate candidates to energize voters in all fifty states rather than selectively targeting swing states. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters in small and large states alike to win a majority. 

Most importantly, the popular vote would ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected. In two of the last five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency due to the Electoral College system. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote. In a democracy, every vote should count equally regardless of what state a person lives in. By switching to a national popular vote, we can ensure the president elected has the consent of a majority of Americans.

For these reasons, I believe changing to a national popular vote system would be a fairer representation of the public will and enhance civic participation across the country. It is the democratic method that best respects the ideal of one person, one vote. I urge you to support transitioning to electing the president by popular vote.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

75,"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris due to smog, and the success of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. By reducing car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change. The example of car-free communities like Vauban, where only 30% of families own cars, shows that it is possible to live without cars and still have a high quality of life.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris highlights how smog levels significantly decreased when cars were restricted. Smog is a major issue in many cities around the world, and car emissions contribute to this problem. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as biking, walking, or public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Promoting alternative forms of transportation is another advantage of limiting car usage. The passage mentions how in Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. This not only promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle but also reduces the need for cars for everyday tasks. Similarly, the car-free days in Bogota encourage people to utilize buses, bikes, or skates for their daily commute. By providing and improving alternative transportation options, we can reduce congestion on the roads and make transportation more accessible for everyone.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. The passage about Vauban highlights how the absence of cars has created a peaceful and pleasant environment, where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children can be heard instead of motor noise. This creates a safer and more enjoyable community for residents. Additionally, car-free zones and pedestrian-friendly streets can encourage social interactions, support local businesses, and improve the overall quality of life in a neighborhood.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive effects of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning strategies and encouraging alternative transportation options, we can build a future that is less dependent on cars and more focused on sustainable and healthy living.",1,490,5,10.642921768707483,11,264.3538512631998
76,"In recent times, we have faced numerous environmental challenges that can be attributed to the over-reliance on automobiles for transportation. Excessive car usage is responsible for an alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions, urban smog, and overall environmental degradation. By limiting car usage, we may significantly improve our environment and overall quality of life.

One of the key justifications for limiting car usage is environmental preservation. Cars, especially those that run on diesel and petrol, are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting the use of cars, we can significantly reduce such emissions and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can substantially reduce air pollution. Several cities have started implementing partial car bans and observed substantial improvement in air quality. For instance, Paris, faced with near-record levels of smog, enforced a partial driving ban, leading to a 60% drop in congestion and better air quality (Duffer, 2014). Bogota, Colombia, has also adopted the concept of ""car-free"" days, encouraging residents to use alternative modes of transport, leading to an improvement in air quality and a decrease in the everyday stress associated with traffic (Selsky, 2002). 

Moreover, reducing car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles. For example, in the car-free suburb of Vauban, residents walk and bike more frequently, leading to an increase in physical activity and overall well-being (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing dependency on cars and encouraging walking or cycling, we can promote healthier lifestyles while helping to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Moving toward limited car usage also paves the way to advanced urban planning, fostering public transportation, and walkable communities. The suburban experiment in Vauban has demonstrated that with smart planning, it is possible to create settlements that are less car-dependent (Rosenthal, 2009). This not only helps in reducing carbon emissions but also inculcates a sense of community among the residents and fosters sustainable living. 

In conclusion, reducing car usage offers multiple advantages including environmental preservation, improved air quality, healthier lifestyles, and advanced urban planning. As we progress toward a future dominated by climate change concerns and sustainability considerations, limiting car usage offers a significant step in this direction. It is incumbent upon us all to embrace sustainable practices like using public transportation, walking, biking, or carpooling to contribute to a healthier planet and a brighter future.",1,413,7,11.628519277108435,11,241.25481196759713

78,"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology in classrooms to read student emotions is problematic and should not be implemented. While identifying emotions could provide teachers insights into how students are feeling, it risks invasion of student privacy and adds an unnecessary layer of surveillance. 

FACS aims to discern emotions like happiness, sadness, fear and more based on facial muscle movements. In a classroom setting, this means monitoring and analyzing expressions across students' faces without consent. Students deserve privacy over their personal reactions and feelings, which they may not want broadcast and recorded. FACS could collect a vast amount of sensitive emotional data on minors without proper oversight or restriction.

Additionally, emotional expressions are complex and context dependent. What appears as anger could indicate frustration with difficult material rather than behavioral issues. Remote facial scanning may misread emotions or lack context for cultural differences in expression. Teachers already have the opportunity to observe students in person and gauge general engagement or discomfort levels. Advanced technology is not needed when human judgment and interaction can achieve the same goals in a less invasive manner.

While the goals of FACS are to provide insight, its application in schools raises serious ethical issues that have not been adequately addressed. Students' privacy and well-being should be the top priority, not exhaustive emotional surveillance. The potential downsides significantly outweigh the speculative benefits of this technology in classrooms. Overall, FACS use does not seem appropriate or necessary for education purposes when simpler, less problematic methods are available. Schools would do better spending resources on improved learning materials rather than questionable emotion-scanning tools.",1,268,0,11.125023880597016,7,246.4942769547167
79,"Supporting the Electoral College to Preserve the Integrity of Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections, as opposed to replacing it with a popular vote system. Although there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, I believe that the Electoral College provides greater certainty of outcome, ensures that candidates have broad national appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, restores balance for large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a definitive outcome in presidential elections. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the counting and legitimacy of individual votes can initiate prolonged legal battles, the Electoral College offers a more succinct process that allows for a resolution to be reached. This was evident in the close 2000 election, which would have been further complicated and potentially led to a constitutional crisis if it were solely determined by the popular vote. The Electoral College system avoids such uncertainties and provides more stability in the democratic process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the need for presidential candidates to have widespread appeal across different regions. A candidate must secure support from multiple states to accumulate the required electoral votes, promoting campaigns that focus on the concerns of various communities across the country. This prevents candidates from solely targeting populous states or demographic strongholds, which would result in regional favoritism and disregard the interests of citizens in other areas. By maintaining the Electoral College, we ensure that every state and its residents receive attention and representation throughout the campaign process.

In addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to engage with and address the concerns of swing states. These states, which have a history of voting for different parties in different elections, hold significant influence in determining the outcome of the presidential race. By concentrating campaign efforts in swing states, candidates are incentivized to tailor their platforms and policies to the needs and preferences of these diverse electorates. This increases voter engagement and allows for a more informed decision-making process by citizens who are most likely to directly impact the election's outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance for large states. Due to the unequal distribution of electoral votes across states, candidates are motivated to campaign in highly populated regions, even if those states are not consistently aligned with their party affiliation. This ensures that densely populated states, such as California and Texas, do not monopolize political attention, allowing smaller states to have a voice and participate actively in the presidential elections. The Electoral College system accounts for the diverse interests of states and ensures that all citizens have a fair opportunity to influence the election outcome.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the presidential election process. By requiring a candidate to secure an absolute majority of electoral votes, the system avoids the need for additional rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority in the popular vote. This efficiency saves time and resources and ensures the election process proceeds smoothly.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in solidly partisan states, it is important to note that individual votes rarely determine presidential elections. The idea that a single vote may be the deciding factor is not a common expectation among voters. Despite this, the percentage of voter turnout remains consistently high in presidential elections, indicating that people participate in the electoral process to express their political preferences rather than to influence the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides a time-tested framework that maintains the integrity of presidential elections. Its retention ensures that outcomes are not subject to prolonged disputes, candidates possess national appeal, swing states receive adequate attention, large states are not disproportionately favored, and run-off elections are avoided. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating potential changes to the election process and to support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

80,"Introduction:

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" discusses the difficulties and risks involved in exploring the planet Venus. Despite these challenges, the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea using evidence from the article.

Claim:
The author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting the potential benefits of exploration, the importance of understanding Venus's atmosphere, and the technological advancements that can come from such exploration.

Evidence:

One piece of evidence that supports the author's claim is the potential benefits of exploring Venus. The author mentions that Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, making it a prime candidate for studying the effects of climate change. By studying Venus's atmosphere, scientists can gain a better understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the planet's climate, which can help us understand how to mitigate the effects of climate change on Earth. Additionally, the author points out that studying Venus can also help us understand the potential for life on other planets. This information is crucial in the search for extraterrestrial life and can help us better understand the universe.

Another piece of evidence that supports the author's claim is the importance of understanding Venus's atmosphere. The author explains that Venus's atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, which creates a strong greenhouse effect that makes the planet's surface temperature reach up to 462 degrees Celsius. This extreme environment makes Venus a unique laboratory for studying the effects of greenhouse gases and the potential for life on other planets. By studying Venus's atmosphere, scientists can gain a better understanding of how to protect Earth from the negative effects of climate change.

Finally, the author highlights the technological advancements that can come from exploring Venus. The author mentions that the challenges of exploring Venus require scientists to develop new technologies that can withstand the extreme environment. These technologies can then be used in future missions to other planets, making space exploration more accessible and affordable.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The potential benefits of exploration, the importance of understanding Venus's atmosphere, and the technological advancements that can come from such exploration all contribute to the author's argument. While exploring Venus is challenging, the benefits of doing so far outweigh the risks. Therefore, I agree with the author that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit that can lead to valuable discoveries and advancements in space exploration.",1,431,5,10.87318064665127,18,238.06278350235445
81,"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom is problematic and an invasion of privacy. While identifying students' emotions could provide teachers insights to better engage students, this technology comes with significant risks that outweigh the potential benefits. 

Facial recognition tools are still imperfect and run the risk of misreading students' emotions or falsely identifying expressions. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their facial expressions and private emotions are being monitored and analyzed without their consent. This could undermine feelings of trust in the learning environment. Students should feel free to openly think and process new ideas without constant monitoring of their emotional reactions. 

Teachers also may misinterpret what facial expressions actually represent about a student's level of engagement, interest, or understanding. A bored expression does necessarily mean a student is not understanding the material - they could just be tired that day. Relying too heavily on these tools risks shallow evaluations of learning that do not consider each student's full circumstances or abilities. 

Identification of emotions also does not tell teachers the root cause that led to an emotion. Students may feel stressed for reasons completely unrelated to the lesson, like issues at home. Without context, emotional profiling provides an incomplete picture and may lead to incorrect assumptions. 

Finally, widespread use of this technology raises serious privacy concerns. Data collected on students' facial expressions and emotional profiling could be vulnerable to data breaches or misuse over time in ways that negatively impact students. Both students and parents deserve a say in how private student data is collected and used in the classroom.

In conclusion, while tools like facial recognition may provide some insights, the risks to student privacy and learning dynamics outweigh the potential value in a classroom context. Technologies should seek students' consent and not undermine important conditions for learning like trust, critical thought and self-determination. Strong privacy protections and appropriate oversight are necessary to justify widespread use of emotional tracking tools in schools.",1,337,0,11.094539285714285,11,198.81928336561455

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College and the method of electing the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I am of the view that we should continue using the Electoral College rather than switching to a popular vote system. While I acknowledge the arguments made by those in favor of a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves its purpose by promoting certainty, representing all regions of the country, ensuring attention to swing states, balancing the weight of large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Posner argues, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents lengthy disputes over the election outcome and guarantees a clear winner. A tie in the Electoral College is highly unlikely given the system's winner-take-all approach in most states. This certainty is essential for maintaining confidence in our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country is represented in the election. Without this system, presidential candidates would be inclined to focus solely on densely populated areas, ignoring smaller states and disregarding the concerns of their residents. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that elected presidents represent the interests of all Americans, not just those in heavily populated regions.

Next, the Electoral College encourages attention to swing states. In a close election, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts in states where the outcome is uncertain, engaging with voters and addressing their specific concerns. This gives swing state voters a unique opportunity to shape the election by choosing the candidate whose policies align most closely with their own interests. The Electoral College guarantees that these thoughtful voters play a significant role in deciding the outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. As Judge Posner points out, the electoral votes awarded to a state depend on its population, granting more attention and influence to larger states. This balances the inherent discrepancy created by the mal-apportionment of the Senate, which favors small states. By considering both state population and electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates cannot simply dismiss smaller states when campaigning.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate the process and prolong the uncertainty. As illustrated by the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College provides a clear winner even if the candidate does not have a majority of the popular vote. This preserves the simplicity and efficiency of our election system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may deter potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, these voters still have the opportunity to express their political preference and engage in the democratic process. The interests of the nation as a whole must be taken into account, and our focus should be on electing a president who can effectively lead and represent all Americans, regardless of their state's political tendencies.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be upheld as the method for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty, ensures representation for all regions, promotes attention to swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. The arguments against the Electoral College fail to recognize these important benefits and the unique role it plays in our democratic system.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College before determining your stance on this issue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and actions on this important matter.

83,"Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many countries as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve quality of life. This essay will outline the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from the passages.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where reliance on cars is highest, it is possible to drastically reduce these emissions.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to extreme levels of pollution. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participated in a car-free day to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. The reduction in air pollution from cars can lead to a decrease in respiratory diseases and other health issues associated with poor air quality. Additionally, promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, can encourage people to be more physically active, leading to improved overall health and wellbeing.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is an example of a car-free community where streets are designed for pedestrians and bicycles, rather than cars. In these communities, stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for long car trips to malls or shopping centers. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a sense of community and encourages social interaction.

Finally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car-reduced"" communities, and legislators are considering measures to prioritize public transportation. These initiatives could lead to increased investment in public transit systems, creating job opportunities and stimulating economic growth. Additionally, individuals can save money by reducing car ownership and relying more on alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit or cycling.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of air quality, promotion of public health, creation of more compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. As more countries and cities adopt measures to limit car usage, it is important for citizens to consider the benefits of alternative forms of transportation for a sustainable and healthier future.",1,455,0,11.058840401830118,13,223.6315122124739
84,"Title: Suburban Life Beyond Cars: A Green and Healthy Pathway 

The contemporary world and its patterns of urbanization and mobility have evolved primarily around the use of cars. Cities and suburbs are populated with extensive parking areas and highways, designed to accommodate automobile use. However, there is a shift towards limiting car usage due to numerous socio-economic and environmental benefits as demonstrated by examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.

In Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, the idea of “smart planning” takes centre stage as residents give up on cars, leading to a more peaceful, tension-free community (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 1-4). This has become possible through a city layout with reduced space for cars and widespread public transportation systems. The focus is on making suburbs more compact and bring shops a walk away, which not only improves accessibility but also significantly reduces greenhouse emissions from cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5-7).

In Paris, smog pollution led authorities to enforce a partial driving ban during a day, creating a significant reduction in congestion and demonstrating an approach to smog reduction (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog” 10, 14). Similarly, in Colombia, the annual car-free day where only buses and taxis are allowed has played a vital role in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" 21, 23-24). 

American cities too are witnessing change. There has been a decline in car purchasing and more people are driving less (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 29-30), largely due to changing social attitudes and improved public transportation. With this shift, the demand for cars is likely going to decrease further, while encouraging a long-term cultural shift of less car usage (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 34-35).

Therefore, limiting car usage brings a multitude of benefits. One of the main advantages is the significant environmental impact. Car emissions are one of the major contributors to harmful greenhouse gases, causing global warming and air pollution (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5). Reducing car usage benefits not only the environment but also public health, as demonstrated by the decreased smog levels in Paris and Bogota. 

Socio-economically, mobility shifts within communities also lead to changes in living habits that promote healthier, more active lifestyles, driving positive community bonds. Opportunities for businesses to thrive are also visible, with public transport facilities, carpooling apps and car-sharing programs becoming more appealing in a car-reduced society (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 37). 

In sum, severely reducing car usage leads to healthier, more sustainable, and more cohesive cities and suburbs. Although these adjustments may seem challenging, the adoption of public transport services and smart-planning, supplemented by forward-looking regulations and policies can make the transition smooth and beneficial, nudging us towards a greener, healthier and more resilient future.",1,485,1,11.541841257716857,15,226.37386971311173
85,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my views on how we elect the President of the United States. As you may know, there is an ongoing debate about whether we should keep the current Electoral College system or change to a popular vote. Both sides have reasonable arguments, so I will do my best to consider the different perspectives in a fair and thoughtful manner.

Those who support keeping the Electoral College claim that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on a few heavily populated areas. It promotes the federal character of our elections by giving every state, regardless of size, a voice in selecting the president. However, opponents argue persuasively that the system can result in a president being elected despite losing the national popular vote. This has occurred a few times throughout history, most recently in 2000 and 2016. They believe this undermines the principle of one person, one vote.

While protecting the voice of smaller states is important, outright disregarding the will of the nationwide popular vote seems fundamentally undemocratic. In a representative democracy, the candidate preferred by the largest number of Americans should likely become president. The counterargument is that the United States was designed as a federation of sovereign states, not a purely popular democracy. But many also feel the original reasons for implementing the Electoral College in the late 18th century do not fully apply to modern sensibilities and a vastly expanded population. 

After weighing both perspectives, I am more aligned with transitioning to a national popular vote. While no system is perfect, candidates elected by a clear popular vote majority will have a stronger democratic mandate. This could help address concerns about close national elections still resulting in a president who received fewer total votes. A national popular vote also seems more consistent with principles of equality and fairness. However, reasonable people can disagree on this complex issue with reasonable arguments on both sides. I appreciate you considering my views and hope we can have an open discussion about selecting leaders in a way that best reflects the will of all Americans.

Thank you for your time and for your service as our state's senator. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

86,"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could provide some benefits, but it also raises serious ethical concerns that outweigh those benefits. 

FACS was created to help computers better understand human emotions by analyzing facial muscle movements. Proponents argue this technology could help teachers gain insights into how their students are reacting to lessons. If a teacher noticed many students appearing bored or confused during a particular lesson, FACS data may help identify areas for improvement. Some suggest this could help personalize instruction to better meet student needs.

However, there are real risks to constantly monitoring students' emotions without their consent. FACS collects sensitive personal data about people without their explicit permission. Students deserve privacy while in school and should not have to feel like they are under surveillance. Constant tracking of emotions could undermine trust in student-teacher relationships and psychologically pressure students to control their natural emotional responses. It may even stifle creativity or independent thinking if students feel they are always being judged.

Additionally, facial expressions do not always accurately convey how someone is feeling internally. Context is needed to properly interpret emotions. A computer system like FACS is unlikely to fully understand the multiple factors potentially influencing a student's expression at any given moment. There is a risk it could lead to incorrect assumptions or inappropriate responses from teachers based on misread data. 

While FACS technology aims to provide insight, the potential downsides of invading student privacy and misinterpreting emotional data outweigh any benefits. Overall, tracking student emotions without consent is ethically questionable and unlikely to truly help personalize instruction in a meaningful way. For these reasons, using FACS in classrooms to monitor student expressions cannot be considered appropriate or valuable.",1,296,0,11.274887042925279,9,220.4359877410175
87,"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Perspectives from Across the Globe 

Car usage has been a staple of modern society since the mid-twentieth century, but today, due to environmental concerns and the impact on quality of life, many cities are exploring the benefits of limiting car usage. The suburb of Vauban, Germany exemplifies this trend. Vauban has banned cars except for essential travel, leading to 70 percent of families not owning cars. Residents reported being happier without the anxiety of owning a car (Rosenthal). Moreover, the community has set an example, helping to drive the ‘smart planning’ trend across Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. Limiting car usage not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also urges city planners for more compact suburbs with better access to public transportation (Rosenthal). 

Paris, as a response to near-record pollution, implemented a temporary, partial ban on driving (Duffer). As a consequence, congestion reduced by 60 percent after five days. In encouraging citizens to find alternative transportation methods, not only does this strategy reduce emissions, it can improve the livability of cities by reducing traffic and pollution.

In Bogotá, Colombia, the annual 'Day Without Cars' event fosters significant community engagement in using alternative transportation methods, further raising awareness and commitment towards reducing smog and air pollution. The result is not only a decrease in traffic congestion but also lesser stress and air pollution (Selsky).

Changes in American behavior indicate we may be coming to an end of car culture. Analysis shows the number of miles driven per person in the U.S. has fallen almost 9 percent from its peak in 2005, a drop that began even before the economic recession. This shift away from car usage could have beneficial implications on carbon emissions and the environment. Demographic shifts also reinforce this trend, as fewer young people are getting licenses while older people maintain theirs. Furthermore, better public transportation, bicycle and pedestrian networks, and car-sharing programs increasingly provide alternatives to car ownership (Rosenthal).

Taking both global and national perspectives into consideration, the benefits of limiting car usage are multifaceted. They include reduced carbon emissions, lesser traffic congestion, and improved quality of life. Crucially, attitudes towards cars and driving are changing, particularly amongst younger generations. This presents excellent opportunities for policy-makers to build on, encouraging further shift towards a culture that values alternative transportation methods, thereby yielding sustainable development for the world.
   
In conclusion, transforming our cities and lifestyles towards minimizing car use can offer fundamental benefits to our environment, health, and overall quality of life. Thus, it is essential to continue encouraging these changes globally for better, more sustainable future societies.",1,436,3,11.460186229032928,13,266.20250777918864
88,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by a popular vote of the American people. While the Electoral College was established by the founders with the aim of having each state be represented, I believe the popular vote better reflects the will of the citizens.

One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. This means that the vast majority of states receive little attention, and their citizens feel ignored. A popular vote system would encourage candidates to appeal to voters across the entire nation, not just selective swing states. It would make every vote truly equal and give voice to more Americans. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, small states would be neglected. Yet a popular vote does not diminish any state's role. Candidates would still try to earn support from voters in all 50 states. Some may express concern that large, population-heavy states would dominate national elections, but candidates would still need to form a majority coalition including many other states to win. A national popular vote does not advantage large states alone.

Most importantly, the popular vote aligns with the fundamental principle that in a democracy, the winner should be who receives the most individual votes nationally. While the Electoral College process usually results in the candidate who earned the most votes winning, it is possible for the candidate with fewer national votes to take office. This undermines the idea of one person, one vote. In an era where we have grown accustomed to seeing vote tallies nationally, the Electoral College system can seem unnecessarily complex and indirect. 

For these reasons, I believe changing to a national popular vote would strengthen our democracy and ensure that every American's ballot carries the same weight in selecting their president. The will of the national majority should be what determines the outcome each election. I encourage you to support electoral reform to implement this fairer system.

Thank you for your consideration.",1,376,7,9.188394893617023,13,228.04053413176482

Growing up on a ranch in Kansas, I never thought I would have the opportunity to see the ocean, let alone experience life on the open seas. However, when I learned about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew I had to participate. This once-in-a-lifetime program allowed me to travel far beyond my everyday surroundings and immerse myself in new cultures and landscapes. If you are someone who dreams of adventure and craves experiences that will stay with you forever, then the Seagoing Cowboys is the opportunity for you. 

The Seagoing Cowboys program exposed me to locations and ways of life I never would have encountered otherwise. During my six months at sea, I visited over a dozen ports around the world, from Australia and Indonesia to the Mediterranean and Caribbean. In each new place, I broadened my understanding of other cultures through meaningful interactions with locals. Whether helping with a cattle drive in outback Australia or learning traditional dances in the Azores, I was continually stepping outside my comfort zone in the most rewarding of ways. I also grew to appreciate the sheer beauty of coastlines, oceans and marine life in a way that could never be achieved by simply looking at pictures.

Living and working aboard the boat for an extended period was no easy task, but it built my character and pushed me physically in ways that have stayed with me. There were many long days of difficult manual labor to maintain the vessel and care for the cattle. However, the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt from facing challenges high on the open ocean was incredibly powerful. I also gained valuable skills such as navigation, weather observation, heavy lifting and mechanical repairs that will serve me well throughout my career. 

If you want to experience the thrill of adventure while visiting unforgettable places, expanding your worldview and developing important life skills, then I cannot recommend the Seagoing Cowboys program highly enough. By joining me in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you will return home a changed person with a lifetime of immersive memories to look back on fondly. So what are you waiting for?

90,"While the notion of aliens sculpting an enormous face on Mars seems exciting, the evidence clearly shows the ""Face on Mars"" is simply a natural landform. Numerous factors point to the face being a result of Mars' weathering and erosion over millions of years rather than intentional creation. 

One of the strongest pieces of evidence is the way light and shadows dramatically alter the appearance of the formation from different angles. When NASA's Viking orbiter photographed it in the 1970s under certain lighting, simple ridges and slopes tricked the eye into seeing facial features like eyes and a nose. Later images from different angles revealed it to be an undisguised mesa or butte. If aliens had deliberately carved a face, it would maintain recognizable features from any vantage point rather than transforming so dramatically with lighting.

Additionally, the face's scale does not logically match the enormous effort required for construction. At only about 1.5 kilometers wide, any face carved by an intelligent civilization would likely have been much larger to be discernible from orbit or even up close. Its miniature stature indicates natural processes gradually eroded slopes into vague eye and mouth-like shapes over eons rather than purposeful sculpting. 

Perhaps most convincingly, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter collected radar images and stereo photos of the entire planet in 1998 at higher resolution than before. These revealed the face to be completely consistent with the dozens of other mesas in the area formed by geological forces rather than artificial design. With no anomalous materials or distinctive techniques detected, the face exhibits the very same wind and water erosion seen everywhere else on Mars. 

In conclusion, while speculation about aliens visiting Mars captures imaginations, extensive data from multiple NASA missions has conclusively shown the ""Face on Mars"" formation was shaped entirely by natural processes over millions of years. Its appearance arises from tricks of light and shadows interacting with simple landforms, not from intelligent design or construction. The evidence overwhelmingly supports classifying the face as one of Mars' many uniquely eroded mesas and buttes.",1,342,0,11.260895684007707,9,231.21968603446493
91,"Hey there fellow cititzens! Today Im gonna tell you why we should limit car usage. First of all, cars are a big polluter. They release harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the air. This pollution is bad for our health and it also contributes to climate change. Climate change is a big problem that affects everyone on Earth. It causes things like sea level rise, more intense storms, and really hot summers. We should limit car usage to reduce the amount of pollution in the air.

Another reason we should limit car usage is that it's better for our health. When we drive cars, we're not getting any exercise. Exercise is important for our bodies and minds. It helps us stay healthy and strong. If we walk or bike instead of drive, we get exercise and we don't have to worry about pollution. Plus, walking and biking are fun! We can enjoy the fresh air and see the sights around us.

Cars also make a lot of noise. Have you ever noticed how loud it is when you're driving? It's like a big roar all around you. That noise is bad for our ears and it can make us stressed out. If we limit car usage, we can have a quieter, more peaceful community.

So what can we do instead of driving? We can walk, bike, or take public transportation. These are all great options that are better for our health and the environment. We can also carpool with our friends or family. This way, we can still use cars sometimes, but we'll be using them less often.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a good idea for many reasons. It reduces pollution, it's better for our health, it makes our community quieter, and it helps us save money on gas. So let's try to use cars less often and use other ways to get around. We can make a difference!

92,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This essay will explore the benefits of reducing automobile dependency, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing automobile dependency, communities can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. This reduction in emissions can have a positive impact on air quality as well.

The improvement in air quality is another advantage of limiting car usage. In Robert Duffer's article, it is mentioned that the smog in Paris reached levels comparable to Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The main culprit for this smog was diesel fuel, which France heavily favors over gasoline due to tax policies. By decreasing car usage, especially diesel-fueled vehicles, communities can improve air quality and reduce the negative health effects associated with pollution.

Promotion of alternative transportation is another crucial advantage of limiting car usage. Andrew Selsky's article describes the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This event aimed to reduce smog and promote public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can encourage the use of more sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides individuals with healthier and more environmentally-friendly options for getting around.

Additionally, limiting car usage can contribute to the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article about the German suburb of Vauban, it is mentioned that street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in this car-free community. Instead, large garages are provided at the edge of the development, emphasizing the prioritization of pedestrians and public transportation. This approach allows for the design of communities that are compact, walkable, and accessible to public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can create safer and more enjoyable environments for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities. By reducing automobile dependency and embracing sustainable transportation options, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and a more enjoyable way of life. It is imperative that society recognizes the benefits of limiting car usage and takes active steps towards achieving a more sustainable future.",1,460,0,11.562369565217391,13,272.63077313747704
93,"While the Facial Action Coding System technology described in the article aims to provide insight into students' emotional states, its use to analyze facial expressions in the classroom raises some valid concerns. On one hand, this technology could help teachers understand how their lessons are being received on an individual level and allow them to adjust their teaching approaches if students seem disengaged or confused. Identifying strong negative emotions like frustration early on may help teachers address issues before they escalate. However, there are also risks to closely monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent. Continuously analyzing facial cues could infringe on students' privacy and feel oppressive or distracting over time. It may also lead teachers to make assumptions without understanding the full context of students' lives outside the classroom. Rather than gaining a nuanced perspective, this technology risks reducing complex human emotions and experiences to simple data points. Before widespread adoption, more research is needed on how this technology specifically impacts student well-being, autonomy, and the student-teacher relationship. While the goals of helping teachers and improving education are reasonable, new technologies must be carefully evaluated to avoid unintended negative consequences, especially those that involve monitoring individuals without choice or transparency. On balance, the concerns outweigh the potential benefits, suggesting this type of classroom facial expression analysis would not presently be advisable or valuable.",1,224,0,11.09173642857143,1,0.0
94,"Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As an informed citizen and constituent, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the texts provided, and I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the current system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes over the election outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. Furthermore, with almost all states using a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another crucial advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes a president who has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This system ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also engenders the sentiment that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates focus their efforts on these states, which can translate into increased voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states, therefore, play a crucial role in determining the election outcome, as voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of political influence between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed in the Constitution, disadvantages large states in terms of their representation. However, the Electoral College partially rectifies this discrepancy by rewarding larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This way, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and issues facing both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system provides an effective means of avoiding run-off elections. It ensures that a clear winner is always declared, preventing the need for additional elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature streamlines the presidential election process and reduces complexity and potential complications.

While advocates for a direct popular vote argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, the information provided in the texts demonstrates that the system has practical benefits and aligns with key democratic principles. The Electoral College ensures certainty, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages meaningful voter participation, balances political influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly support maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. It serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair and representative elections. I kindly request that you consider these perspectives when determining your position on this matter. Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

95,"Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method used to elect the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College continues to be the most effective and fair approach for a variety of reasons.

One of the primary reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the President has a clear mandate and legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. With each state having a certain number of electors, candidates are compelled to campaign in all states, including those with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from exclusively focusing on heavily populated urban areas and ensures that the concerns and interests of all Americans are taken into account.

In addition, the Electoral College serves to protect the interests of smaller states and less populated regions. It balances the weight that large states hold due to their representation in the House of Representatives, providing a fair voice to states with smaller populations. This helps to prevent the domination of the presidency by a few highly populated states, ensuring a more geographically diverse leadership.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to prevent run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the need for costly and time-consuming run-offs. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined election process, ultimately benefiting the American people.

While some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic, it is important to note that the Electoral College remains a representative process. When we cast our votes for a presidential candidate, we are actually voting for a slate of electors who will then make the final decision. This indirect method of selection allows for the consideration of regional interests and ensures that our democracy remains balanced and fair.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a stable and equitable method for electing the President. It creates certainty in the outcome, gives a voice to all regions of the country, protects the interests of smaller states, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a system that balances democracy and representation, ensuring that the President is elected in a way that is fair, legitimate, and reflective of the diverse interests of our nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College and vote in favor of maintaining this vital component of our democracy.

96,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1,446,9,11.37143947368421,11,291.7353889916042
97,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. Implementing measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce reliance on cars can have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and public health. Several examples from around the world illustrate the benefits of limiting car usage.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, walking, or cycling, we can decrease our emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities, especially in suburban areas, heavy car usage leads to excessive traffic, which not only wastes time but also contributes to pollution and accidents. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburb, only two places to park are available, resulting in 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This low-car suburban life model promotes public transportation and reduces the need for parking spaces, ultimately leading to less congestion on the roads.

Limiting car usage also has positive health effects. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, with diesel fuel being a major culprit (Duffer, 2014). By decreasing car usage, we can improve air quality and, consequently, public health. Furthermore, promoting alternative modes of transportation like walking or cycling can also encourage physical activity, leading to improved overall well-being and a reduction in obesity rates.

Moreover, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and compact development. Traditional suburban developments, with spread-out homes and private garages, have long been the norm. However, new approaches like the Vauban model advocate for more walkable communities with stores located nearby rather than in distant malls (Rosenthal, 2009). This smart planning not only reduces the need for long car trips but also creates vibrant and accessible neighborhoods.

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has become a great success, with millions of Colombians using alternative transportation methods (Selsky, 2002). This event showcases the potential for change and demonstrates that cities can function without the heavy dependence on cars. Furthermore, initiatives like bike-sharing programs and car-sharing services contribute to the overall goal of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving public health, and promoting sustainable development, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities. Examples from around the world demonstrate that alternative modes of transportation can be successful, and it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace these changes for a sustainable future.",1,474,4,11.345171729957807,15,230.72663960241397
98,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to instead elect the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College system was established by the founders with the aim of creating a more deliberative process, I believe it no longer serves that purpose and can undermine the principle of one person, one vote.

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history, including most recently in 2000 and 2016. When a president can lose the popular vote but still win in the electoral college, it undermines the message that every citizen's vote should count equally. It also may discourage some citizens who vote for the candidate who ends up losing the state from voting at all, since their vote essentially does not matter in deciding the statewide outcome.

Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on population centers. However, election by popular vote could still motivate candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters across many states. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters in smaller states as well as large states to win the national popular vote.  Additionally, campaign visits and ad spending under the current system are disproportionately focused on a handful of swing states, rather than candidates truly needing to build a broad coalition nationally. 

Overall, while the Electoral College may have served purposes when it was established, I believe the popular vote would better uphold the democratic principles of one person, one vote and ensure that every citizen's vote counts equally in presidential elections. It would encourage candidates to engage voters nationwide and could increase voter turnout knowing that every vote directly impacts the national outcome. For these reasons, I ask that you support a legislative proposal to implement a national popular vote for electing the president.

99,"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide both benefits and drawbacks. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. If a teacher notices many students appearing bored or confused while they are teaching, they could adjust their lesson plan or teaching methods to better engage the class. Identifying students who seem frustrated or stressed may also allow teachers to offer extra support to those struggling with the material. Overall, FACS could help optimize classroom instruction and ensure all students' learning needs are being met.

However, this technology may also invade students' privacy and make some feel uncomfortable. Constant monitoring of facial expressions may be perceived as intrusive by students who did not consent to having their emotions analyzed. It could potentially discourage natural and spontaneous reactions in the classroom. Students may start to feel they are being judged based solely on their appearance rather than the content of their character. They may feel pressure to mask their true feelings in order to fit certain norms. 

Ultimately, more considerations need to be made around privacy, student consent, and potential unintended consequences before widespread use of this technology in classrooms. While FACS could provide insights to help teachers, it should not be used in a way that compromises students' well-being, autonomy, or right to learn freely without excessive monitoring. With proper safeguards and oversight, this technology could potentially benefit learning experiences if implemented judiciously.
